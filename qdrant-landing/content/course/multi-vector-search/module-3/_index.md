# Scalability and Optimization

Tackle the memory and performance challenges of production-scale multi-vector search.

---

## Today's path

1. Memory Usage Implications and Solutions
2. Vector Quantization Techniques
3. Pooling Techniques
4. MUVERA
5. Multi-Stage Retrieval with Universal Query API
6. Evaluating Search Pipelines

You'll master the optimization strategies needed to deploy multi-vector search at scale.
