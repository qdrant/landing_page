Server hanging is a situation where a server becomes unresponsive and stops processing requests. This guide aims to provide step-by-step troubleshooting instructions to identify and resolve server connection issues.

If you are currently experiencing a hang , please prepare for the following: Troubleshooting Server hangs, memory leaks or resource depletions can be a very difficult and time consuming process of involving multiple attempts to collect the RIGHT data. Ensuring that you have collected the data and that the data is valid before engaging support will greatly reduce the time spent by both you and the support engineer when it comes to identifying the source of the issue.


1. Check connectivity. Use network diagnostic tools to test connectivity and identify any network-related problems.

2. Review System Logs. Examine system logs for error messages, warnings, or patterns that might indicate the cause of the hanging.

3. Monitor Resource Usage. Use system monitoring tools to check CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. High resource usage can lead to server hanging. Identify processes consuming excessive resources and take appropriate action, such as restarting or optimizing them.

4. Update Software and Drivers. Outdated software or drivers can cause compatibility issues leading to server hanging. 

5. Review Hardware Health. Check server hardware components such as RAM, hard drives, power supplies, and cooling systems.
