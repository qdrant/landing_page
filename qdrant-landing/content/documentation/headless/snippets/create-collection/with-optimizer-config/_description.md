Creates a collection with vectors stored in memmap storage and specifies an optimizer configuration with a `memmap_threshold` set to 20000. This configuration is particularly useful for Qdrant instances with fast disks and large collections. The `memmap_threshold` option determines the threshold after which a segment will be converted to memmap storage. It can be set globally in the configuration file or for each collection individually during creation or update.
