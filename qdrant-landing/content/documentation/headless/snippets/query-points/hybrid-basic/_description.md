This code snippet demonstrates a hybrid search functionality where you can query points from a collection using both sparse and dense vectors. The code showcases how to combine the results of multiple queries with different vector representations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). RRF boosts results that are closer to the top in multiple queries. This hybrid search approach can be useful for obtaining semantic and specific word matching results simultaneously.
