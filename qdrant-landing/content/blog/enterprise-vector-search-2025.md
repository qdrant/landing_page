# Introducing Enterprise-Ready Vector Search with Qdrant

Building enterprise scale AI applications isn't just about having a powerful vector database—it also requires security, scalability, and seamless operations. That's why we launched **enterprise-grade features** designed to **streamline authentication, improve access control, enhance monitoring, and simplify infrastructure management**.

Read on to see how Qdrant is redefining what it means to be an **enterprise-ready vector database**.

## The Challenges of Enterprise-Scale Vector Search

Vector search is essential for AI, but scaling it in an enterprise brings **four major challenges**:

### 1. Security & Compliance: Controlling Access at Scale

AI teams need **secure, role-based access** to prevent unauthorized exposure of sensitive data. Without **centralized authentication (SSO) and fine-grained permissions (RBAC, API keys)**, organizations face **compliance risks, credential sprawl, and security vulnerabilities**. 

### 2. Seamless Access Management: Eliminating Credential Chaos

Growing teams need **frictionless authentication** across staging, production, and cloud services. Without **enterprise-wide identity management**, IT teams struggle to onboard users, enforce policies, and prevent **unauthorized access creep**.

### 3. Observability & Monitoring: Understanding Performance at Scale

AI infrastructure is a **black box without real-time metrics**. Teams need **monitoring** to **track latency, resource usage, and query performance**, avoiding costly downtime and slow responses. 

### 4. Automation & Scalability: Reducing Manual Overhead

Deploying and managing clusters manually is **slow, error-prone, and expensive**. Without **APIs**, enterprises waste time on configuration instead of **innovation**. 

Without solving these, enterprises risk **security breaches, compliance failures, downtime, and operational inefficiencies**. That's why we built a feature suite designed to **secure, simplify, and scale vector search**.

## Meet Qdrant's Enterprise Feature Suite

Our enterprise solution handles scaling and securing vector search for production AI systems. Here's how:

### Enterprise-Grade Security & Access Control

**Cloud RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** ***(Coming soon)*** → Define **granular permissions** to manage clusters, billing and Hybrid Cloud deployments.  
[**Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/qdrant-cloud-setup/#enterprise-single-sign-on-sso) → Streamlined authentication via:  
- Okta   
- Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)  
- Azure Active Directory  
- Active Directory/LDAP  
- Azure Active Directory Native  
- ADFS  
- Google Workspace  
- OpenID Connect  
- PingFederate  
- SAML

- [**Database API Keys with Granular Access Control**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/authentication/) → Restrict API key access **per cluster and per collection**, enforce expirations, and revoke credentials instantly.

**Why it matters:** Security is **baked in, not bolted on**. So you get **centralized control** over access management—simplifying compliance and reducing risk.

### Full Observability with Monitoring

* [**Monitoring**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/monitoring/) → **Real-time metrics via Prometheus/OpenMetrics**, integrating directly into your existing monitoring stack (Datadog, Grafana, etc.).

**Why it matters:** Monitor performance, detect anomalies, and **stay ahead of potential issues**—all without custom instrumentation.

### API for simplified management

* [**API**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/authentication/) → Manage clusters, authentication methods, and cloud configurations. 

**Why it matters:** Whether scaling manually or through automation, deploying and managing Qdrant is as easy as a few lines of code.

## A Fully Integrated Enterprise Solution

The true power lies in how these features **work together**:

* **Security \+ Access Management** → **RBAC, SSO and API Keys** create a **zero-trust security framework**  
* **Enterprise Observability** → Monitoring ensures **full visibility** into vector search performance  
* **DevOps Effectiveness** → APIs enable automation

With these features, Qdrant is the **enterprise vector database of choice**—whether you're operating in the cloud, in hybrid deployments, or at massive scale.
