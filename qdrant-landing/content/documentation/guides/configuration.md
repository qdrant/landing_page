# Configuration

To change or correct Qdrant's behavior, default collection settings, and network interface parameters, you can use configuration files.

The default configuration file is located at [config/config.yaml](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/config/config.yaml).

To change the default configuration, add a new configuration file and specify
the path with `--config-path path/to/custom_config.yaml`. If running in
production mode, you could also choose to overwrite `config/production.yaml`.
See [ordering](#order-and-priority) for details on how configurations are
loaded.

The [Installation](../installation/) guide contains examples of how to set up Qdrant with a custom configuration for the different deployment methods.

## Order and priority

*Effective as of v1.2.1*

Multiple configurations may be loaded on startup. All of them are merged into a
single effective configuration that is used by Qdrant.

Configurations are loaded in the following order, if present:

1. Embedded base configuration ([source](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/config/config.yaml))
2. File `config/config.yaml`
3. File `config/{RUN_MODE}.yaml` (such as `config/production.yaml`)
4. File `config/local.yaml`
5. Config provided with `--config-path PATH` (if set)
6. [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

This list is from least to most significant. Properties in later configurations
will overwrite those loaded before it. For example, a property set with
`--config-path` will overwrite those in other files.

Most of these files are included by default in the Docker container. But it is
likely that they are absent on your local machine if you run the `qdrant` binary
manually.

If file 2 or 3 are not found, a warning is shown on startup.
If file 5 is provided but not found, an error is shown on startup.

Other supported configuration file formats and extensions include: `.toml`, `.json`, `.ini`.

## Environment variables

It is possible to set configuration properties using environment variables.
Environment variables are always the most significant and cannot be overwritten
(see [ordering](#order-and-priority)).

All environment variables are prefixed with `QDRANT__` and are separated with
`__`.

These variables:

```bash
QDRANT__LOG_LEVEL=INFO
QDRANT__SERVICE__HTTP_PORT=6333
QDRANT__SERVICE__ENABLE_TLS=1
QDRANT__TLS__CERT=./tls/cert.pem
QDRANT__TLS__CERT_TTL=3600
```

result in this configuration:

```yaml
log_level: INFO
service:
  http_port: 6333
  enable_tls: true
tls:
  cert: ./tls/cert.pem
  cert_ttl: 3600
```

To run Qdrant locally with a different HTTP port you could use:

```bash
QDRANT__SERVICE__HTTP_PORT=1234 ./qdrant
```

## Validation

*Available since v1.1.1*

The configuration is validated on startup. If a configuration is loaded but
validation fails, a warning is logged. E.g.:

```text
WARN Settings configuration file has validation errors:
WARN - storage.optimizers.memmap_threshold: value 123 invalid, must be 1000 or larger
WARN - storage.hnsw_index.m: value 1 invalid, must be from 4 to 10000
```

The server will continue to operate. Any validation errors should be fixed as
soon as possible though to prevent problematic behavior.
