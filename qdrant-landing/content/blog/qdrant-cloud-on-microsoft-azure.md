Great news! We've expanded Qdrant's managed vector database offering — [Qdrant Cloud](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) — to be available on Microsoft Azure. 
You can now effortlessly set up your environment on Azure, which reduces deployment time, so you can hit the ground running.

[Get started](https://cloud.qdrant.io/)

What this means for you:

- **Rapid application development**: Deploy your own cluster through the Qdrant Cloud Console within seconds and scale your resources as needed.
- **Billion vector scale**: Seamlessly grow and handle large-scale datasets with billions of vectors. Leverage Qdrant features like horizontal scaling and binary quantization with Microsoft Azure's scalable infrastructure.

**"With Qdrant, we found the missing piece to develop our own provider independent multimodal generative AI platform at enterprise scale."** -- Jeremy Teichmann (AI Squad Technical Lead & Generative AI Expert), Daly Singh (AI Squad Lead & Product Owner) - Bosch Digital.
