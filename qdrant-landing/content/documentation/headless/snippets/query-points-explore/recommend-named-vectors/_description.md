The code snippet demonstrates how to make a query to explore points in a collection based on named vectors. In this case, the query is configured to recommend vectors specified as 'positive' and 'negative'. By setting the 'using' parameter to "image" and limiting the results to 10, you can retrieve relevant data for the specified vectors in the collection. This feature is available starting from version 0.10.0 and allows for more granular recommendation requests when dealing with multiple vectors in a collection.
