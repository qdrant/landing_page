This code snippet demonstrates a POST request to filter data in a specific collection. The request includes a filter specifying nested conditions on elements within the data array. The nested conditions check for elements with a 'diet' key that matches 'meat' in the 'food' key and 'true' in the 'likes' key. The filter also includes a condition to check if the data has an ID of '1'. It notes that the 'has_id' condition is not supported within the nested filter and should be placed in an adjacent 'must' clause if needed.
