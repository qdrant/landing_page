The new version of our engine - v0.8.0, went live. Let's go through the new features it has:

* On-disk payload storage allows storing more with less RAM usage.
* Distributed deployment support is available. And we continue improving it, so stay tuned for new updates.
* The payload can be indexed in the process without rebuilding the segment.
* Advanced filtering support now includes filtering by similarity score.

Also, it has a faster payload index, better error reporting, HNSW Speed improvements, and many more. Check out the change log for more details [](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases/tag/v0.8.0)https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases/tag/v0.8.0.
