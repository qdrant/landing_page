This code snippet demonstrates how to utilize the `lookup_from` parameter when querying points. By specifying an external collection and vector name to lookup from, you can retrieve recommendations based on vectors from a different collection. This feature is beneficial when dealing with item-to-user recommendation scenarios, where vectors with the same parameters are stored in separate collections.
