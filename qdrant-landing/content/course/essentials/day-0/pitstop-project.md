# Day 0 Task

Reinforce todayâ€™s concepts by creating a small Qdrant project endâ€‘toâ€‘end.

## Objective
Create a tiny, working search that uses your own vectors and payloads.

## Steps
1. Set up the Qdrant environment (local Docker or Cloud).
2. Create a collection named `my_first_collection` (vector size should match your embedding or use small dummy vectors).
3. Insert 5 points with custom vectors and payloads (e.g., categories or tags).
4. Run a similarity search and briefly interpret the top results.

## Hints
- Cosine distance is a solid default for text.
- Keep vectors consistent in size.
- Use the Web UI to add points and test queries quickly, or the Python client if you prefer code.

## Deliverables
- Screenshot or console output showing a search and its results.
- A short writeâ€‘up (2â€“3 sentences) summarizing what you built and what the results mean.

## Submission
Share your screenshot and summary in the courseâ€™s Qdrant Discord channel for feedback. ðŸš€
