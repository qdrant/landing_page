# Vector Quantization Techniques

Vector quantization compresses vectors by reducing the precision of each component. Qdrant supports several quantization methods that can reduce memory usage by 4-32x with minimal quality loss.

Choosing the right quantization method depends on your quality requirements and memory constraints.
