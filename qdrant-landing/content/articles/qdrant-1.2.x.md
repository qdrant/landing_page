A brand-new Qdrant 1.2 release comes packed with a plethora of new features, some of which
were highly requested by our users. If you want to shape the development of the Qdrant vector
database, please [join our Discord community](https://qdrant.to/discord) and let us know
how you use it!

## New features

As usual, a minor version update of Qdrant brings some interesting new features. We love your 
feedback and tried to include the most requested features, as reported by our community.

### Product Quantization

The primary focus of Qdrant was always performance. That's why we built it in Rust, but we were 
always concerned about making vector search affordable. From the very beginning, Qdrant offered 
support for disk-stored collections, as storage space is way cheaper than memory. That's also 
why we have introduced the [Scalar Quantization](/articles/scalar-quantization) mechanism recently, 
which makes it possible to reduce the memory requirements by up to four times.

Today, we are bringing a new quantization mechanism to life. A separate article on 
[Product Quantization](/articles/product-quantization) describes that feature in more detail. 
In a nutshell, you can **reduce the memory requirements by up to 64 times**!

### Optional named vectors

Qdrant has been supporting multiple named vectors per point for quite a long time. Those may have 
utterly different dimensionality and distance functions used to calculate similarity. Having multiple 
embeddings per item is an essential real-world scenario. For example, you might be encoding textual 
and visual data using different models. Or you might be experimenting with different models but 
don't want to make your payloads redundant by keeping them in separate collections.

![Optional vectors](/articles_data/qdrant-1.2.x/optional-vectors.png)

However, up to the previous version, we requested you provide all the vectors for each point. There 
have been many requests to allow nullable vectors, as sometimes you cannot generate an embedding or 
simply don't want to for reasons we don't need to know.

### Grouping requests

Embeddings are great for capturing the semantics of the documents, but we rarely encode larger pieces 
of data into a single vector. Having a summary of a book may sound attractive, but in reality, we 
divide it into paragraphs or some different parts to have higher granularity. That pays off when we 
perform the semantic search, as we can return the relevant pieces only. That's also how modern tools 
like Langchain process the data. The typical way is to encode some smaller parts of the document and 
keep the document id as a payload attribute.

![Query without grouping request](/articles_data/qdrant-1.2.x/without-grouping-request.png)

There are, however, some cases, in which we want to find the relevant parts, but no more than just 
a certain number of results per document, for example a single one only. Up till now, we had to 
implement such a mechanism on the client side and send several calls to the Qdrant engine. But 
that's no longer the case. Qdrant 1.2 provides a mechanism for grouping requests, which can handle 
that server-side, within a single call to the database. This mechanism is similar to the SQL 
`GROUP BY` clause.

![Query with grouping request](/articles_data/qdrant-1.2.x/with-grouping-request.png)

You are not limited to a single result per document - you can select how many entries will be
returned

### Nested filters

Unlike some other vector databases out there, Qdrant accepts any arbitrary JSON payload, including
arrays, objects, and arrays of objects. You can also [filter the search results using nested 
keys](/documentation/filtering/#nested-key), even though arrays (using the `[]` syntax). 

Before Qdrant 1.2 it was actually impossible to express some more complex conditions for the
nested structures. For example, let's assume we have the following payload:

```json
{
  "country": "Japan",
  "cities": [
    {
      "name": "Tokyo",
      "population": 9.3,
      "area": 2194
    },
    {
      "name": "Osaka",
      "population": 2.7,
      "area": 223
    },
    {
      "name": "Kyoto",
      "population": 1.5,
      "area": 827.8
    }
  ]
}
```

We want to filter out the results to include the countries with a city with over 2 million citizens 
and an area bigger than 500 square kilometers but no more than 1000. There is no such a city in 
Japan, looking at our data, but if we wrote the following filter, it would be returned:

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "country.cities[].population",
        "range": {
          "gte": 2
        }
      },
      {
        "key": "country.cities[].area",
        "range": {
          "gt": 500,
          "lte": 1000
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3
}
```

Japan would be returned because Tokyo and Osaka match the first criteria, while Kyoto fulfills 
the second. But that's not what we wanted to achieve. That's the motivation behind introducing 
a new type of nested filter.

```json
{
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "nested": {
          "key": "country.cities",
          "filter": {
            "must": [
              {
                "key": "population",
                "range": {
                  "gte": 2
                }
              },
              {
                "key": "area",
                "range": {
                  "gt": 500,
                  "lte": 1000
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3
}
```

The syntax is consistent with all the other supported filters and enables new possibilities. In 
our case, it allows us to express the joined condition on a nested structure and make the results 
list empty but correct.

## Important changes

The latest release focuses not only on the new features but also introduces some changes making 
Qdrant even more reliable.

### Fixed memory errors on startup

There has been an issue in memory-constrained environments, such as cloud, happening when users were 
pushing massive amounts of data into the service using `wait=false`. This data influx resulted in an 
overreaching of disk or RAM limits before the Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) was fully applied. This 
situation was causing Qdrant to attempt a restart and reapplication of WAL, failing recurrently due 
to the same memory constraints and pushing the service into a frustrating crash loop with many 
Out-of-Memory errors.

Qdrant 1.2 automatically detects if memory usage exceeds a specific threshold, informs a user with an 
error message in the logs, and makes the service halt the loading of collection data and commence 
operations in a partial state. This state allows for removing collections but doesn't support search 
or update functions. If Qdrant enters this locked state, a reboot that either increases available or 
reduces required resources resolves it.

### Appendable mmap

For a long time, segments using mmap storage were `non-appendable` and could only be constructed by 
the optimizer. Dynamically adding vectors to the mmap file is fairly complicated and thus not 
implemented in Qdrant, but we did our best to implement it in the recent release. If you want 
to read more about segments, check out our docs on [vector storage](/documentation/storage/#vector-storage).
