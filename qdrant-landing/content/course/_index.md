# Qdrant Essentials Course

The ultimate guide to production-grade vector search is here. And it’s free.

From your first vector upsert to optimizing high-performance retrieval at scale, this free course takes you from zero to production-ready. Learn how to build efficient vector search, fine-tune Qdrant for maximum performance, and keep your system lightweight, even when working with billions of vectors.

## What Is the Course?

No matter if you're exploring vector search for the first time or fine-tuning a large-scale RAG system, this free course gives you the practical foundation and advanced skills you need.

Over 9 days (plus bonus content), you’ll build up from the fundamentals to advanced deployment strategies with Qdrant. Each module focuses on a single concept or capability, paired with a hands-on exercise to apply what you’ve learned. You will start with basics, build confidence, and gradually progress to complex topics. 

Every day includes a hands-on exercise or mini-project, like creating a collection, uploading points, building a hybrid search pipeline, or tuning the HNSW index.

At the end, you’ll bring everything together by building a full production-grade vector search application. You’ll graduate with a portfolio-worthy project, plus a deep understanding of how to apply Qdrant in production scenarios.
