Since we first announced **[Qdrant Academy](https://qdrant.tech/course/)**, our mission has been to provide developers with more than just documentation. We wanted to build a structured path to mastering vector search. As the AI search landscape matures, the distinction between a simple storage layer and a high-performance vector search engine has become the defining factor in production-grade RAG and recommendation systems.

Today, we are thrilled to take the next step in that mission. It’s time to move from learning to proving your expertise with the launch of our first official certification.

### Introducing the "Qdrant Essentials" Certification

The [Qdrant Essentials course](https://qdrant.tech/course/essentials/) has already helped thousands of developers understand the "why" behind high-dimensional search. Now, you can officially validate that knowledge. 

By completing the course and passing the final exam at **[train.qdrant.dev](https://train.qdrant.dev)**, you’ll earn a digital credential that proves you can architect search systems that are as efficient as they are accurate.

#### What the Essentials Track Covers:
* **Engine Architecture:** Deep dives into HNSW, distance metrics, and collection structures.
* **Precision Filtering:** Mastering payload-based filtering without sacrificing search speed.
* **Hybrid Search:** Implementing a mix of dense and sparse vectors for superior retrieval.
* **Production Optimization:** Utilizing quantization and rescoring to scale your engine efficiently.

### Why Get Certified?

In a field as fast-moving as AI, "knowing a bit of Python" isn't enough. Moving from a prototype to a production-ready system requires specialized engineering judgment. Becoming **#QdrantCertified** can be a game-changer for your career:

* **Verified Expertise:** It proves you understand the critical trade-offs—like balancing latency vs. accuracy—that separate a hobbyist project from enterprise infrastructure.
* **Career Differentiation:** As companies hunt for RAG and Agentic AI experts, this badge signals that you can handle high-scale vector search, reducing your onboarding time and making you an immediate asset.
* **Standardized Knowledge:** You aren't just learning from assorted tutorials; you’re learning the industry standard for high-performance retrieval directly from the creators of Qdrant.
* **Engineering Authority:** Gain the confidence to lead internal AI workshops or architect your company's next-gen search platform using verified best practices.

### Get Certified. Get Swag.

We want to see those certificates! To celebrate the launch of our certification platform, we’re sending out some exclusive gear to our early achievers.

> **The first 30 people** to post their Qdrant Essentials certification to LinkedIn with the hashtag **#QdrantCertified** will receive a free Qdrant swag pack. 

It’s simple: Learn, pass the exam at [train.qdrant.dev](https://train.qdrant.dev), and share your success with the community to claim your prize.

### More Courses Launching Soon

The "Essentials" course is just the foundation. Qdrant Academy is expanding rapidly to support developers at every stage of their journey:

#### The 2-Hour Beginner Launchpad
Coming soon, we are launching a **2-hour Basic Course**. This is designed for those who need a high-impact, low-time-commitment introduction to the world of vector search. You’ll go from "What is an embedding?" to "I have a running search engine" in a quick yet comprehensive Qdrant intro.

#### Advanced Retrieval Topics
For the power users, our upcoming **Multivectors Course** will tackle the cutting edge of retrieval. It will focus on Late Interaction models (like ColBERT), and will cover sophisticated retrieval with MUVERA. You’ll learn how to handle token-level embeddings to achieve incredible retrieval precision for complex datasets.

## Ready to Level Up?
