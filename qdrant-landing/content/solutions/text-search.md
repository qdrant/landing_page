    The neural search uses **semantic embeddings** instead of keywords and works best with short texts.
    With Qdrant, you can build and deploy semantic neural search on your data in minutes.
    Check out our [demo](https://qdrant.to/semantic-search-demo)!

Full-text search does not always provide the desired result.
Documents may have too few keywords, or queries might be too large.

One way to overcome these problems is a neural network-based semantic search, which can be used in conjunction with traditional search.
The neural search uses **semantic embeddings** to find texts with similar meaning.

With Qdrant, you can build and deploy semantic neural search on your data in minutes!
