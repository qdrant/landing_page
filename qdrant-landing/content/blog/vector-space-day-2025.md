## Vector Space Day 2025: Powered by Qdrant 

📍 Colosseum Berlin, Germany  
🗓️ Friday, September 26, 2025

### About

We’re hosting our first-ever full-day in-person [**Vector Space Day**](https://lu.ma/p7w9uqtz) this September in Berlin, and you’re invited.

The Vector Space Day will bring together engineers, researchers, and AI builders to explore the cutting edge of retrieval, vector search infrastructure, and agentic AI. From building scalable RAG pipelines to enabling real-time AI memory and next-gen context engineering, we’re covering the full spectrum of modern vector-native search.

### Why You Should Attend

* **Deep-dives & lightning talks**: Learn from the teams solving hard problems in AI infrastructure, search relevance, and semantic retrieval in production.  
* **Panels & debates**: Discuss the future of AI agents, multimodal memory, context-aware RAG, and vector-native developer workflows.   
* **Meet the community**: This isn’t just a conference. It’s a gathering of the developers rethinking how AI systems search, retrieve, and reason at scale.

### Topics We’ll Explore

We’re intentionally keeping things broad. If you work on any of the following, the Vector Space Day 2025 is your event:

* Vector databases & similarity search  
* AI memory and context management  
* Agent frameworks & orchestration  
* RAG pipelines & evaluation  
* Context engineering for retrieval & generation  
* Prompt construction and context window optimization  
* Real-time retrieval systems  
* Hybrid and semantic search at scale

### After Party
The day doesn’t end when the last session wraps. Your ticket includes access to the After Party. Unwind, connect with fellow attendees, and keep the conversations going over drinks, music, and light bites. Whether you're debriefing a lightning talk or sketching out your next RAG experiment on a napkin, it's the perfect way to close out the day.

### Partners

We’ll be joined by leading organizations including AWS, Microsoft, Vultr, Jina, DeepSet, LlamaIndex, TwelveLabs, n8n, Neo4j, Superlinked, Linkup, DataTalks.Club, and the MLOps Community, and more. 

These partners represent a cross-section of the most influential players in AI infrastructure and applied research, and we’re proud to collaborate with them to bring this event to life. 

Their involvement underscores the growing momentum behind vector search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems—and this is just the beginning.
