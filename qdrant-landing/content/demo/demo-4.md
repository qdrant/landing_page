title: Semantic code search
short_description: Searching over Qdrant source code using semantic search
description: Navigating an unknown codebase can be a daunting task. This demo shows how to implement a semantic search application for code search tasks, using two different neural encoders. The demo uses a general-purpose sentence transformer and a code-specific model to allow both natural and code-like queries and cover a broader spectrum of possible interactions.
