Vector search engine can be used to match candidates and jobs even if there are no matching keywords or explicit skill descriptions. 
For example, it can automatically map **'frontend engineer'** to **'web developer'**, no need for any predefined categorization.
Neural job matching is used at [MoBerries](https://www.moberries.com/) for automatic job recommendations.
