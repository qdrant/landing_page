# Scalability and Optimization

Tackle the memory and performance challenges of production-scale multi-vector search.

---

## Today's path

1. Multi-Stage Retrieval with Universal Query API
2. Vector Quantization Techniques
3. Pooling Techniques
4. MUVERA
5. Evaluating Search Pipelines
6. Final Project

You'll master the optimization strategies needed to deploy multi-vector search at scale. The module concludes with a final project where you'll apply all the learned skills to build a real-world multi-vector search system for multi-modal data.
