[Qdrant 1.10.0 is out!](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases/tag/v1.10.0) This version introduces some major changes, so let's dive right in:

**Universal Query API:** All search APIs, including Hybrid Search, are now in one Query endpoint.</br>
**Built-in IDF:** We added the IDF mechanism to Qdrant's core search and indexing processes.</br>
**Multivector Support:** Native support for late interaction ColBERT is accessible via Query API.

## One Endpoint for All Queries
**Query API** will consolidate all search APIs into a single request. Previously, you had to work outside of the API to combine different search requests. Now these approaches are reduced to parameters of a single request, so you can avoid merging individual results. 

You can now configure the Query API request with the following parameters:

|Parameter|Description|
|-|-|
|no parameter|Returns points by `id`|
|`nearest`|Queries nearest neighbors ([Search](/documentation/concepts/search/))|
|`fusion`|Fuses sparse/dense prefetch queries ([Hybrid Search](/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/#hybrid-search))|
|`discover`|Queries `target` with added `context` ([Discovery](/documentation/concepts/explore/#discovery-api))|
|`context` |No target with `context` only ([Context](/documentation/concepts/explore/#context-search))|
|`recommend`|Queries against `positive`/`negative` examples. ([Recommendation](/documentation/concepts/explore/#recommendation-api))|
|`order_by`|Orders results by [payload field](/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/#re-ranking-with-payload-values)|

For example, you can configure Query API to run [Discovery search](/documentation/concepts/explore/#discovery-api). Let's see how that looks:

```http
POST collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
  "query": {
    "discover": {
      "target": <vector_input>,
      "context": [
        {
          "positive": <vector_input>,
          "negative": <vector_input>
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

We will be publishing code samples in [docs](/documentation/concepts/hybrid-queries/) and our new [API specification](http://api.qdrant.tech).</br> *If you need additional support with this new method, our [Discord](https://qdrant.to/discord) on-call engineers can help you.*

### Native Hybrid Search Support
Query API now also natively supports **sparse/dense fusion**. Up to this point, you had to combine the results of sparse and dense searches on your own. This is now sorted on the back-end, and you only have to configure them as basic parameters for Query API. 

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
    "prefetch": [
        {
            "query": { 
                "indices": [1, 42],    // <┐
                "values": [0.22, 0.8]  // <┴─sparse vector
             },
            "using": "sparse",
            "limit": 20
        },
        {
            "query": [0.01, 0.45, 0.67, ...], // <-- dense vector
            "using": "dense",
            "limit": 20
        }
    ],
    "query": { "fusion": "rrf" }, // <--- reciprocal rank fusion
    "limit": 10
}
```

```rust
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{Fusion, PrefetchQueryBuilder, Query, QueryPointsBuilder};

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

client.query(
    QueryPointsBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
        .add_prefetch(PrefetchQueryBuilder::default()
            .query(Query::new_nearest([(1, 0.22), (42, 0.8)].as_slice()))
            .using("sparse")
            .limit(20u64)
        )
        .add_prefetch(PrefetchQueryBuilder::default()
            .query(Query::new_nearest(vec![0.01, 0.45, 0.67]))
            .using("dense")
            .limit(20u64)
        )
        .query(Query::new_fusion(Fusion::Rrf))
).await?;
```

```java
import static io.qdrant.client.QueryFactory.nearest;

import java.util.List;

import static io.qdrant.client.QueryFactory.fusion;

import io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;
import io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Points.Fusion;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Points.PrefetchQuery;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Points.QueryPoints;

QdrantClient client = new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder("localhost", 6334, false).build());

client.queryAsync(
    QueryPoints.newBuilder()
    .setCollectionName("{collection_name}")
    .addPrefetch(PrefetchQuery.newBuilder()
      .setQuery(nearest(List.of(0.22f, 0.8f), List.of(1, 42)))
      .setUsing("sparse")
      .setLimit(20)
      .build())
    .addPrefetch(PrefetchQuery.newBuilder()
      .setQuery(nearest(List.of(0.01f, 0.45f, 0.67f)))
      .setUsing("dense")
      .setLimit(20)
      .build())
    .setQuery(fusion(Fusion.RRF))
    .build())
  .get();
```

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.QueryAsync(
  collectionName: "{collection_name}",
  prefetch: new List < PrefetchQuery > {
    new() {
      Query = new(float, uint)[] {
          (0.22f, 1), (0.8f, 42),
        },
        Using = "sparse",
        Limit = 20
    },
    new() {
      Query = new float[] {
          0.01f, 0.45f, 0.67f
        },
        Using = "dense",
        Limit = 20
    }
  },
  query: Fusion.Rrf
);
```

Query API can now pre-fetch vectors for requests, which means you can run queries sequentially within the same API call. There are a lot of options here, so you will need to define a strategy to merge these requests using new parameters. For example, you can now include **rescoring within Hybrid Search**, which can open the door to strategies like iterative refinement via matryoshka embeddings. 

*To learn more about this, read the [Query API documentation](/documentation/concepts/search/#query-api).*

## Inverse Document Frequency [IDF]

IDF is a critical component of the **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** weighting scheme used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus).
There are various ways in which IDF might be calculated, but the most commonly used formula is:

$$
\text{IDF}(q_i) = \ln \left(\frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{n(q_i) + 0.5}+1\right)
$$

Where:</br>
`N` is the total number of documents in the collection. </br>
`n` is the number of documents containing non-zero values for the given vector.

This variant is also used in BM25, whose support was heavily requested by our users. We decided to move the IDF calculation into the Qdrant engine itself. This type of separation allows streaming updates of the sparse embeddings while keeping the IDF calculation up-to-date.

The values of IDF previously had to be calculated using all the documents on the client side. However, now that Qdrant does it out of the box, you won't need to implement it anywhere else and recompute the value if some documents are removed or newly added.

You can enable the IDF modifier in the collection configuration:

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "sparse_vectors": {
        "text": {
            "modifier": "idf"
        }
    }
}
```

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models
client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    sparse_vectors={
        "text": models.SparseVectorParams(
            modifier=models.Modifier.IDF,
        ),
    },
)
```

```rust
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{CreateCollectionBuilder, sparse_vectors_config::SparseVectorsConfigBuilder, Modifier, SparseVectorParamsBuilder};

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

let mut config = SparseVectorsConfigBuilder::default();
config.add_named_vector_params(
    "text",
    SparseVectorParamsBuilder::default().modifier(Modifier::Idf),
);

client
    .create_collection(
        CreateCollectionBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
            .sparse_vectors_config(config),
    )
    .await?;
```

```java
import io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;
import io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.CreateCollection;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.Modifier;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.SparseVectorConfig;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.SparseVectorParams;

QdrantClient client =
  new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder("localhost", 6334, false).build());

client
  .createCollectionAsync(
    CreateCollection.newBuilder()
    .setCollectionName("{collection_name}")
    .setSparseVectorsConfig(
      SparseVectorConfig.newBuilder()
      .putMap("text", SparseVectorParams.newBuilder().setModifier(Modifier.Idf).build()))
    .build())
  .get();
```

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.CreateCollectionAsync(
  collectionName: "{collection_name}",
  sparseVectorsConfig: ("text", new SparseVectorParams {
    Modifier = Modifier.Idf,
  })
);
```

### IDF as Part of BM42

This quarter, Qdrant also introduced BM42, a novel algorithm that combines the IDF element of BM25 with transformer-based attention matrices to improve text retrieval. It utilizes attention matrices from your embedding model to determine the importance of each token in the document based on the attention value it receives.

We've prepared the standard `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer so [it outputs the attention values](https://huggingface.co/Qdrant/all_miniLM_L6_v2_with_attentions). Still, you can use virtually any model of your choice, as long as you have access to its parameters. This is just another reason to stick with open source technologies over proprietary systems.

In practical terms, the BM42 method addresses the tokenization issues and computational costs associated with SPLADE. The model is both efficient and effective across different document types and lengths, offering enhanced search performance by leveraging the strengths of both BM25 and modern transformer techniques.

> To learn more about IDF and BM42, read our [dedicated technical article](/articles/bm42/).

**You can expect BM42 to excel in scalable RAG-based scenarios where short texts are more common.** Document inference speed is much higher with BM42, which is critical for large-scale applications such as search engines, recommendation systems, and real-time decision-making systems.

## Multivector Support 
We are adding native support for multivector search that is compatible, e.g., with the late-interaction [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) model. If you are working with high-dimensional similarity searches, **ColBERT is highly recommended as a reranking step in the Universal Query search.** You will experience better quality vector retrieval since ColBERT’s approach allows for deeper semantic understanding. 

This model retains contextual information during query-document interaction, leading to better relevance scoring. In terms of efficiency and scalability benefits, documents and queries will be encoded separately, which gives an opportunity for pre-computation and storage of document embeddings for faster retrieval. 

**Note:** *This feature supports all the original quantization compression methods, just the same as the regular search method.* 

**Run a query with ColBERT vectors:**

Query API can handle exceedingly complex requests. The following example prefetches 1000 entries most similar to the given query using the `mrl_byte` named vector, then reranks them to get the best 100 matches with `full` named vector and eventually reranks them again to extract the top 10 results with the named vector called `colbert`. A single API call can now implement complex reranking schemes.

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/points/query
{
    "prefetch": {
        "prefetch": {
            "query": [1, 23, 45, 67], // <------ small byte vector
            "using": "mrl_byte",
            "limit": 1000
        },
        "query": [0.01, 0.45, 0.67, ...], // <-- full dense vector
        "using": "full",
        "limit": 100
    },
    "query": [           // <─┐
        [0.1, 0.2, ...], // < │
        [0.2, 0.1, ...], // < ├─ multi-vector
        [0.8, 0.9, ...]  // < │
    ],                   // <─┘       
    "using": "colbert",
    "limit": 10
}
```

```rust
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{PrefetchQueryBuilder, Query, QueryPointsBuilder};

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

    QueryPointsBuilder::new("{collection_name}")
        .add_prefetch(PrefetchQueryBuilder::default()
            .add_prefetch(PrefetchQueryBuilder::default()
                .query(Query::new_nearest(vec![1.0, 23.0, 45.0, 67.0]))

            .setLimit(10)
            .build())
    .get();
```

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.QueryAsync(
  collectionName: "{collection_name}",
  prefetch: new List <PrefetchQuery> {
    new() {
      Prefetch = {
          new List <PrefetchQuery> {
            new() {
              Query = new float[] { 1, 23, 45, 67 }, // <------------- small byte vector
                Using = "mrl_byte",
                Limit = 1000
            },
          }
        },
        Query = new float[] {0.01f, 0.45f, 0.67f}, // <-- dense vector
        Using = "full",
        Limit = 100
    }
  },
  query: new float[][] {
    [0.1f, 0.2f], // <─┐
    [0.2f, 0.1f], // < ├─ multi-vector
    [0.8f, 0.9f]  // < ┘
  },
  usingVector: "colbert",
  limit: 10
);
```

**Note:** *The multivector feature is not only useful for ColBERT; it can also be used in other ways.*</br> 
For instance, in e-commerce, you can use multi-vector to store multiple images of the same item. This serves as an alternative to the [group-by](/documentation/concepts/search/#grouping-api) method. 

## Sparse Vectors Compression

In version 1.9, we introduced the `uint8` [vector datatype](/documentation/concepts/vectors/#datatypes) for sparse vectors, in order to support pre-quantized embeddings from companies like JinaAI and Cohere. 
This time, we are introducing a new datatype **for both sparse and dense vectors**, as well as a different way of **storing** these  vectors. 

**Datatype:** Sparse and dense vectors were previously represented in larger `float32` values, but now they can be turned to the `float16`. `float16` vectors have a lower precision compared to `float32`, which means that there is less numerical accuracy in the vector values - but this is negligible for practical use cases. 

These vectors will use half the memory of regular vectors, which can significantly reduce the footprint of large vector datasets. Operations can be faster due to reduced memory bandwidth requirements and better cache utilization. This can lead to faster vector search operations, especially in memory-bound scenarios.

When creating a collection, you need to specify the `datatype` upfront:

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}
{
    "vectors": {
      "size": 1024,
      "distance": "Cosine",
      "datatype": "float16"
    }
}
```

```java
import io.qdrant.client.QdrantClient;
import io.qdrant.client.QdrantGrpcClient;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.CreateCollection;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.Datatype;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.Distance;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.VectorParams;
import io.qdrant.client.grpc.Collections.VectorsConfig;

QdrantClient client = new QdrantClient(QdrantGrpcClient.newBuilder("localhost", 6334, false).build());

client
  .createCollectionAsync(
    CreateCollection.newBuilder()
    .setCollectionName("{collection_name}")
    .setVectorsConfig(VectorsConfig.newBuilder()
      .setParams(VectorParams.newBuilder()
        .setSize(1024)
        .setDistance(Distance.Cosine)
        .setDatatype(Datatype.Float16)
        .build())
      .build())
    .build())
  .get();
```

```rust
use qdrant_client::Qdrant;
use qdrant_client::qdrant::{CreateCollectionBuilder, Datatype, Distance, VectorParamsBuilder};

let client = Qdrant::from_url("http://localhost:6334").build()?;

client
    .create_collection(
        CreateCollectionBuilder::new("{collection_name}").vectors_config(
            VectorParamsBuilder::new(1024, Distance::Cosine).datatype(Datatype::Float16),
        ),
    )
    .await?;
```

```csharp
using Qdrant.Client;
using Qdrant.Client.Grpc;

var client = new QdrantClient("localhost", 6334);

await client.CreateCollectionAsync(
  collectionName: "{collection_name}",
  vectorsConfig: new VectorParams {
    Size = 1024,
    Distance = Distance.Cosine,
    Datatype = Datatype.Float16
  }
);
```

**Storage:** On the backend, we implemented bit packing to minimize the bits needed to store data, crucial for handling sparse vectors in applications like machine learning and data compression. For sparse vectors with mostly zeros, this focuses on storing only the indices and values of non-zero elements. 

You will benefit from a more compact storage and higher processing efficiency. This can also lead to reduced dataset sizes for faster processing and lower storage costs in data compression.

## New Rust Client

Qdrant’s Rust client has been fully reshaped. It is now more accessible and
easier to use. We have focused on putting together a minimalistic API interface.
All operations and their types now use the builder pattern, providing an easy
and extensible interface, preventing breakage with future updates. See the Rust
[ColBERT query](#multivector-support) as great example. Additionally,
Rust supports safe concurrent execution, which is crucial for handling multiple
simultaneous requests efficiently.

Documentation got a significant improvement as well. It is much better organized
and provides usage examples across the board. Everything links back to our main
documentation, making it easier to navigate and find the information you need.

## S3 Snapshot Storage
Qdrant **Collections**, **Shards** and **Storage** can be backed up with [Snapshots](/documentation/concepts/snapshots/) and saved in case of data loss or other data transfer purposes. These snapshots can be quite large and the resources required to maintain them can result in higher costs. AWS S3 and other S3-compatible implementations like [min.io](https://min.io/) is a great low-cost alternative that can hold snapshots without incurring high costs. It is globally reliable, scalable and resistant to data loss.

You can configure S3 storage settings in the [config.yaml](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/config/config.yaml), specifically with `snapshots_storage`.

For example, to use AWS S3:

```yaml
storage:
  snapshots_config:
    # Use 's3' to store snapshots on S3
    snapshots_storage: s3

    s3_config:
      # Bucket name
      bucket: your_bucket_here

      # Bucket region (e.g. eu-central-1)
      region: your_bucket_region_here

      # Storage access key
      # Can be specified either here or in the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment variable.
      access_key: your_access_key_here

      # Storage secret key
      # Can be specified either here or in the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable.
      secret_key: your_secret_key_here
```

*Read more about [S3 snapshot storage](/documentation/concepts/snapshots/#s3) and [configuration](/documentation/guides/configuration/).*

This integration allows for a more convenient distribution of snapshots. Users of **any S3-compatible object storage** can now benefit from other platform services, such as automated workflows and disaster recovery options. S3's encryption and access control ensure secure storage and regulatory compliance. Additionally, S3 supports performance optimization through various storage classes and efficient data transfer methods, enabling quick and effective snapshot retrieval and management.
