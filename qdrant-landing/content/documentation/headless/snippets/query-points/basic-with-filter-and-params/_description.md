This code snippet represents a search query that specifies certain filtering criteria and parameters to query points within a collection. The query is targeting points based on specified coordinates, with a filter applied to only include points where the 'city' key matches the value 'London'. Additionally, parameters such as 'hnsw_ef' and 'exact' are set to optimize the search. The search is requested to return a maximum of 3 matching results.
