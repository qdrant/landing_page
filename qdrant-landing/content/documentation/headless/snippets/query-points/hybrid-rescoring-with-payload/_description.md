This code snippet showcases a scenario where a collection of points can be queried with a focus on the contents of the payload data associated with each point. The example demonstrates the use of dense vectors as queries along with filters based on payload fields such as 'color' with values like "red" or "green". Additionally, the results can be limited and ordered based on a specific payload field such as "price". This functionality allows for more refined and customized querying based on both vector similarity and payload content.
