Qdrant is a vector database performing an approximate nearest neighbours search on neural embeddings. It can work perfectly fine
as a standalone system, yet, in some cases, you may find it easier to implement your semantic search application using some
higher-level libraries. Some of such projects provide ready-to-go integrations and here is a curated list of them.

## DocArray
You can use Qdrant natively in DocArray, where Qdrant serves as a high-performance document store to enable scalable vector search.

DocArray is a library from Jina AI for nested, unstructured data in transit, including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc.
It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer the data with a Pythonic API.


To install DocArray with Qdrant support, please do

```bash
pip install "docarray[qdrant]"
```

More information can be found in [DocArray's documentations](https://docarray.jina.ai/advanced/document-store/qdrant/).

## txtai
Qdrant might be also used as an embedding backend in [txtai](https://neuml.github.io/txtai/) semantic applications.

txtai simplifies building AI-powered semantic search applications using Transformers. It leverages the neural embeddings and their 
properties to encode high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space and allows to find similar objects based on their embeddings' 
proximity.

Qdrant is not built-in txtai backend and requires installing an additional dependency:

```bash
pip install qdrant-txtai
```

The examples and some more information might be found in [qdrant-txtai repository](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-txtai).

## Cohere
Qdrant is compatible with Cohere [co.embed API](https://docs.cohere.ai/reference/embed) and it's official Python SDK that
might be installed as any other package:

```bash
pip install cohere
```

The embeddings returned by co.embed API might be used directly in the Qdrant client's calls:

```python
import cohere
import qdrant_client

from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

cohere_client = cohere.Client("<< your_api_key >>")
qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    points=Batch(
        ids=[1],
        vectors=cohere_client.embed(
            model="large",
            texts=["The best vector database"],
        ).embeddings,
    )
)
```

If you are interested in seeing an end-to-end project created with co.embed API and Qdrant, please check out the
"[Question Answering as a Service with Cohere and Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/articles/qa-with-cohere-and-qdrant/)" article.

## OpenAI
Qdrant can also easily work with [OpenAI embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings). There is an 
official OpenAI Python package that simplifies obtaining them, and it might be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

Once installed, the package exposes the method allowing to retrieve the embedding for given text. OpenAI requires an API key
that has to be provided either as an environmental variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` or set in the source code directly, as 
presented below:

```python
import openai
import qdrant_client

from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

# Provide OpenAI API key and choose one of the available models:
# https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview
openai.api_key = "<< your_api_key >>"
embedding_model = "text-embedding-ada-002"

response = openai.Embedding.create(
    input="The best vector database",
    model=embedding_model,
)

qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
qdrant_client.upsert(
    collection_name="MyCollection",
    points=Batch(
        ids=[1],
        vectors=[response["data"]["embedding"]],
    )
)
```

## Aleph Alpha
Aleph Alpha is a multimodal and multilingual embeddings' provider. Their API allows creating the embeddings for text and images, both 
in the same latent space. They maintain an [official Python client](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/aleph-alpha-client) that might be 
installed with pip:

```bash
pip install aleph-alpha-client
```

There is both synchronous and asynchronous client available. Obtaining the embeddings for an image and storing it into Qdrant might 
be done in the following way:

```python
import qdrant_client

from aleph_alpha_client import (
    Prompt,
    AsyncClient,
    SemanticEmbeddingRequest,
    SemanticRepresentation,
    ImagePrompt
)
from qdrant_client.http.models import Batch

aa_token = "<< your_token >>"
model = "luminous-base"

qdrant_client = qdrant_client.QdrantClient()
async with AsyncClient(token=aa_token) as client:
    prompt = ImagePrompt.from_file("./path/to/the/image.jpg")
    prompt = Prompt.from_image(prompt)

    query_params = {
        "prompt": prompt,
        "representation": SemanticRepresentation.Symmetric,
        "compress_to_size": 128,
    }
    query_request = SemanticEmbeddingRequest(**query_params)
    query_response = await client.semantic_embed(
        request=query_request, model=model
    )
    
    qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name="MyCollection",
        points=Batch(
            ids=[1],
            vectors=[query_response.embedding],
        )
    )
```

If we wanted to create text embeddings with the same model, we wouldn't use `ImagePrompt.from_file`, but simply provide the input 
text into the `Prompt.from_text` method.
