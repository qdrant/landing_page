# OpenLIT

[OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit) is an OpenTelemetry-native LLM Application Observability tool and includes OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation to monitor Qdrant and provide insights to improve database operations and application performance.

For more information on how to use OpenLIT, see the [OpenLIT docs](https://docs.openlit.io/).

This page assumes you're using `qdrant-client` version 1.7.3 or above.

## Usage

### Step 1: Install OpenLIT

Open your command line or terminal and run:

```bash
pip install openlit
```

### Step 2: Initialize OpenLIT in your Application
Integrating OpenLIT into LLM applications is straightforward with just **two lines of code**: 

```python
import openlit

openlit.init()
```

To forward telemetry data to an HTTP OTLP endpoint, such as the OpenTelemetry Collector, set the `otlp_endpoint` parameter with the desired endpoint. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

<aside role="status">
ðŸ’¡ Info: If you don't provide `otlp_endpoint` function argument or set the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable, OpenLIT directs the trace directly to your console, which can be useful during development.

To send telemetry to OpenTelemetry backends requiring authentication, set the `otlp_headers` parameter with its desired value. Alternatively, you can configure the endpoint by setting the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable as recommended in the OpenTelemetry documentation.

## Next Steps

With the LLM Observability data now being collected by OpenLIT, the next step is to visualize and analyze this data to get insights into your LLM applicationâ€™s performance, behavior, and identify areas of improvement.

To begin exploring your LLM Application's performance data within the OpenLIT UI, please see the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/quickstart).

If you want to integrate and send metrics and traces to your existing observability tools like Promethues+Jaeger, Grafana or more, refer to the [Official Documentation for OpenLIT Connections](https://docs.openlit.io/latest/connections/intro) for detailed instructions.
