We are happy to announce that [Jina.AI](https://jina.ai/) integrates Qdrant engine as a storage backend to their [DocArray](https://docarray.jina.ai/) solution.

Now you can experience the convenience of Pythonic API and Rust performance in a single workflow.

DocArray library defines a structure for the unstructured data and simplifies processing a collection of documents,
including audio, video, text, and other data types. Qdrant engine empowers scaling of its vector search and storage.
