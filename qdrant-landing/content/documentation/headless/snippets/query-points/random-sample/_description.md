This code snippet demonstrates how to perform random sampling on a collection of data points. It allows for retrieving a random subset of points, which can be beneficial for tasks like debugging, testing, or facilitating exploratory analysis. The random sampling functionality is accessible through the Universal Query API and can be integrated similarly to typical search operations.
