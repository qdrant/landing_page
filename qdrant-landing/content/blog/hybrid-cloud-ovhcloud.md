With the official release of [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](/hybrid-cloud/), businesses running their data infrastructure on [OVHcloud](https://ovhcloud.com/) are now able to deploy a fully managed vector database in their existing OVHcloud environment. We are excited about this partnership, which has been established through the [OVHcloud Open Trusted Cloud](https://opentrustedcloud.ovhcloud.com/en/) program, as it is based on our shared understanding of the importance of trust, control, and data privacy in the context of the emerging landscape of enterprise-grade AI applications. As part of this collaboration, we are also providing a detailed use case tutorial on building a recommendation system that demonstrates the benefits of running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud.

Deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud's infrastructure represents a significant leap for European businesses invested in AI-driven projects, as this collaboration underscores the commitment to meeting the rigorous requirements for data privacy and control of European startups and enterprises building AI solutions. As businesses are progressing on their AI journey, they require dedicated solutions that allow them to make their data accessible for machine learning and AI projects, without having it leave the company's security perimeter. Prioritizing data sovereignty, a crucial aspect in today's digital landscape, will help startups and enterprises accelerate their AI agendas and build even more differentiating AI-enabled applications. The ability of running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud not only underscores the commitment to innovative, secure AI solutions but also ensures that companies can navigate the complexities of AI and machine learning workloads with the flexibility and security required.

> *“The partnership between OVHcloud and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud highlights, in the European AI landscape, a strong commitment to innovative and secure AI solutions, empowering startups and organisations to navigate AI complexities confidently. By emphasizing data sovereignty and security, we enable businesses to leverage vector databases securely.“*  Yaniv Fdida, Chief Product and Technology Officer, OVHcloud
