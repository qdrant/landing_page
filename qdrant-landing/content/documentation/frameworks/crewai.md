# CrewAI

[CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com) is a framework for orchestrating role-playing, autonomous AI agents. By leveraging collaborative intelligence, CrewAI allows agents to work together seamlessly, tackling complex tasks.

The framework has a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents. This system aids agents to remember, reason, and learn from past interactions. You can use Qdrant to store short-term memory and entity memories of CrewAI agents.

- Short-Term Memory

Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using RAG, enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions.

- Entity Memory

Entity Memory Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses RAG for storing entity information.

## Usage with Qdrant

We'll learn how to customize CrewAI's default memory storage to use Qdrant.

### Installation

First, install CrewAI and Qdrant client packages:

```shell
pip install 'crewai[tools]' 'qdrant-client[fastembed]'
```

### Setup a CrewAI Project

You can learn to set up a CrewAI project [here](https://docs.crewai.com/installation#create-a-new-crewai-project). Let's assume the project was name `mycrew`.

### Define the Qdrant storage

> src/mycrew/storage.py

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional

from crewai.memory.storage.rag_storage import RAGStorage
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient


class QdrantStorage(RAGStorage):
    """
    Extends Storage to handle embeddings for memory entries using Qdrant.

    """

    def __init__(self, type, allow_reset=True, embedder_config=None, crew=None):
        super().__init__(type, allow_reset, embedder_config, crew)

    def search(
        self,
        query: str,
        limit: int = 3,
        filter: Optional[dict] = None,
        score_threshold: float = 0,
    ) -> List[Any]:
        points = self.client.query(
            self.type,
            query_text=query,
            query_filter=filter,
            limit=limit,
            score_threshold=score_threshold,
        )
        results = [
            {
                "id": point.id,
                "metadata": point.metadata,
                "context": point.document,
                "score": point.score,
            }
            for point in points
        ]

        return results

    def reset(self) -> None:
        self.client.delete_collection(self.type)

    def _initialize_app(self):
        self.client = QdrantClient()
        if not self.client.collection_exists(self.type):
            self.client.create_collection(
                collection_name=self.type,
                vectors_config=self.client.get_fastembed_vector_params(),
                sparse_vectors_config=self.client.get_fastembed_sparse_vector_params(),
            )

    def save(self, value: Any, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        self.client.add(self.type, documents=[value], metadata=[metadata or {}])
```

The `add` AND `query` methods use [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/) to vectorize data. You can however customize it if required.

### Instantiate your crew

You can learn about setting up agents and tasks for your crew [here](https://docs.crewai.com/quickstart). We can update the instantiation of `Crew` to use our storage mechanism.

> src/mycrew/crew.py

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.memory.entity.entity_memory import EntityMemory
from crewai.memory.short_term.short_term_memory import ShortTermMemory

from mycrew.storage import QdrantStorage

Crew(
    # Import the agents and tasks here.
    memory=True,
    entity_memory=EntityMemory(storage=QdrantStorage("entity")),
    short_term_memory=ShortTermMemory(storage=QdrantStorage("short-term")),
)
```

You can now run your Crew workflow with `crew run`. It'll use Qdrant for memory ingestion and retrieval.
