This code snippet demonstrates a POST request to count points based on specific filter conditions within a collection. The filter criteria include checking for points with a key "color" that matches the value "red" precisely. By setting the "exact" parameter to true, the count will consider only exact matches. This functionality is helpful for scenarios such as evaluating result sizes for faceted search, determining pagination numbers, and debugging query performance.
