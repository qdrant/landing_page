Over the past several weeks, builders from around the world proved that vector search is about much more than chatbots. We challenged teams to think beyond RAG, and they delivered: robotics safety reflexes, event discovery on routes, 3D shopping, video game characters, and more.

Winners were announced live in Berlin on Friday, September 26, 2025 at [Vector Space Day](https://luma.com/p7w9uqtz). Full hackathon details are here: [Hackathon page](https://try.qdrant.tech/hackathon-2025).

With numerous submissions from around the world, hackathon judges used criteria of Creativity, Technical Depth, and Qdrant Usage to evaluate each submission and determine the top projects. There was $10,000 in prizes from Qdrant as well as many additional bonus prizes for using partner tech:

Let‚Äôs dive into the top projects and what we liked about each of them.

**What it is:** A 3D product exploration experience that turns e-commerce discovery into an explorable world. Categories become mountains; subcategories become hills; terrain height reflects result counts; and an LLM ‚Äúguide‚Äù (Q-Bert) leads a curated tour.

**How it works:** Embeddings (Mistral) ‚Üí Qdrant similarity search ‚Üí Neo4j graph curation ‚Üí UMAP visualization ‚Üí 3D terrain in React Three Fiber. Final 7 items are narrated by the guide agent.

### ü•à 2nd Place: RoboBank (Sanya Kapoor)

**Total Prize: `$3000 USD`**

  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

**What it is:** An AI trajectory memory and reflex suggestion system for robots. It ‚Äúbanks‚Äù short sensor-action sequences as vectors, labels them by safety, and retrieves the safest neighbor to suggest the next move. Demoed in a 2D simulator, designed for real robotics.

**Stack:** Qdrant for trajectory memory, near-neighbor retrieval, real-time fallback suggestions, safe/unsafe labels, and reflex replay.

**Repo:** [RoboBank](https://github.com/kanungle/RoboBank)

### ü•â 3rd Place: Spatio-Temporal NPCs (cortexandcode)

**Total Prize: `$2000 USD`**

  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>

**What it is:** Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) that *remember* places, events, and interactions using spatio-temporal memory, so behavior evolves naturally instead of being scripted.

**How it works:**

* **Brain:** GPT-OSS-120B (MoE) as the conscious planner; subconscious memory in Qdrant.

* **Memories:** CLIP embeddings \+ scene descriptions for ‚Äúimage memories‚Äù; text embeddings for ‚Äúevent memories‚Äù; all tagged with locations.

* **Perception & I/O:** whisper-cpp for speech, PiperTTS for output, CLIP \+ MiniLM for embeddings.

* **Performance:** Runs locally with \~3GB VRAM, 1-2s latency, and \<$1/day in compute.

**Repo:** [Spatio-Temporal NPCs](https://github.com/inventwithdean/spatio-temporal-npcs)

## Why These Projects Matter

These projects show what happens when developers apply vector retrieval to new domains:

* Robots that learn safer behavior.  
* NPCs that grow with memory.  
* Social platforms that connect people by personality.  
* Music and dance fused through embeddings.  
* Route-aware discovery tools and multi-modal classrooms.  
* Local-first, privacy-preserving knowledge vaults.

We really enjoyed these projects‚Äô creativity especially, and the direction many of them took towards the use of future edge technologies with vector retrieval, like with [Qdrant Edge](https://qdrant.tech/edge/).

As with any hackathon, there were tons of amazing submissions, and we wish we could showcase them all, but we hope this sample showcases the strong power of the Qdrant Community when tasked with new challenges and creative approaches.

## What‚Äôs Next

We‚Äôll be publishing deep dives and hosting winner interviews over the coming weeks and months. Keep an eye out for these by [subscribing to our newsletter](https://qdrant.tech/community/)\!

A huge thank you to everyone who built, mentored, or joined. You‚Äôve proven that with Qdrant, the possibilities are limitless.
