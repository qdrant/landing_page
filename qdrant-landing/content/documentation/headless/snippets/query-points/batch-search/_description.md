This code snippet demonstrates the batch search feature of a system. The batch search API allows you to send multiple search queries in a single request. Each search query includes a set of criteria to filter results and a limit on the number of expected results. By batching search requests together, the system can optimize processing by sharing intermediary results when queries have the same filters. This approach helps reduce network connections and improve overall efficiency, especially for complex filters. To use the batch search API, package your search requests together with the desired criteria.
