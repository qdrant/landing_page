title: Semantic code search
short_description: Searching over Qdrant source code using semantic search
description: It can be difficult to go through an unknown codebase. This demo shows how to implement a semantic search application for code search tasks, with two neural encoders. These encoders are a general-purpose sentence transformer and a code-specific model. This supports both natural and code-like queries, which covers a broad range of interactions.
