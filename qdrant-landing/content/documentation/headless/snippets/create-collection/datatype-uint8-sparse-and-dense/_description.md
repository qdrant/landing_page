When working with vectors in a collection, you can specify the datatype as Uint8 for both dense and sparse vectors. Uint8 represents integer numbers from 0 to 255, which is different from floating-point numbers. 

For dense vectors, make sure the values fall within the range of 0 to 255. If the embeddings generated by your model are not in this range, you will need to quantize the values to convert them. 

Some embedding providers may offer pre-quantized embeddings like Cohere int8 & binary embeddings. If not, you will have to perform quantization yourself.

It's important to note that while dense vectors must be in the 0 to 255 range, sparse vectors allow for in-flight quantization. This distinction should be considered when handling Uint8 vectors.
