This code snippet showcases a context-based approach for performing a search operation on a collection of points. The search involves specifying positive and negative context points along with a limit on the number of results to be returned. By using a context score derived from the triplet-loss concept, the search is guided towards areas with fewer negative examples. This method allows for a more diverse and constrained result set, rather than only focusing on a single point. The approach can be utilized not just for general searching but also for recommendation systems by adapting it to specific use cases.
