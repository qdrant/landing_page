This code snippet creates a collection configured for BM25-based lexical retrieval. It defines a sparse named vector with the IDF modifier enabled,ensuring that the Inverse Document Frequency, a core component of the BM25 scoring formula, is calculated on Qdrant’s side. This setup allows Qdrant to perform BM25-style retrieval based on keyword frequency and rarity.
