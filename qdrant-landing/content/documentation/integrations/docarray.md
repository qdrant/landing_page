# DocArray
You can use Qdrant natively in DocArray, where Qdrant serves as a high-performance document store to enable scalable vector search.

DocArray is a library from Jina AI for nested, unstructured data in transit, including text, image, audio, video, 3D mesh, etc.
It allows deep-learning engineers to efficiently process, embed, search, recommend, store, and transfer the data with a Pythonic API.


To install DocArray with Qdrant support, please do

```bash
pip install "docarray[qdrant]"
```
