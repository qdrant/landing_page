title: Bug Bounty Program

# Bug Bounty Program Overview
We prioritize user trust and adhere to the highest privacy and security standards. This is why we actively invite security experts to identify vulnerabilities and commit to collaborating with them to resolve issues swiftly and effectively.
Qdrant values the security research community and supports the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities in our products and services. Through our bug bounty program, we reward researchers who help enhance the security of our platform.

## Responsible Disclosure Program Rules
- Include detailed, reproducible steps in your reports. We will not reward issues you cannot reproduce.
- Submit one vulnerability per report unless you need to chain multiple vulnerabilities to demonstrate impact.
- In cases of duplicate reports, we will reward only the first reproducible report.
- We will consider vulnerabilities stemming from the same root cause as a single issue and award only one bounty.
- We strictly prohibit social engineering attacks (e.g., phishing, vishing, smishing).
- Interact only with accounts you own or have explicit permission to access. Do not test using Qdrant employee accounts or internal tools.
- Before you run automated scanners, please check with us first.

### In Scope
The Bug Bounty program covers the following areas:
- *.cloud.qdrant.io Qdrant Cloud Application
- [qdrant.tech](http://qdrant.tech/) Website

In most cases, we will only reward the following types of vulnerabilities:
- Arbitrary code execution and OS Command Injection
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (Stored XSS)
- SQL injection
- File Upload
- Authentication bypass and privilege escalation (authentication / authorization circumvention)
- Significant Sensitive Data Exposure
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Critical Business Logic Flaws

### Out of Scope
We always exclude the following areas:
- Findings related to intended functionality or accepted business risks
- Qdrant support system on https://support.qdrant.io
- Third-party applications or websites
- Staging or test environments
- Social engineering attacks
- DoS/DDoS attacks
- User/email enumeration
- Brute-force attacks
- Physical security issues
- Reports from automated tools or scanners
- Generic information disclosure, such as the `Server` or `X-Powered-By` headers
- Email security: DMARC, DKIM, SPF, etc.
- Spamming that rate limiting techniques can prevent
- Missing DNSSEC
- CSRF for Login, Logout and Signup pages
- Cross-site scripting that requires full control of a http header, such as Referer, Host etc.
- Clickjacking and Tabnabbing

## Severity Levels and Rewards
- We assess reported bugs based on their risk and other relevant factors; our response may take some time.
- We tend to award higher rewards for submissions that include detailed remediation steps or recommendations.
- We determine bounty amounts based on multiple factors, including the vulnerability’s impact, the ease of exploitation, and the quality of the report. Please note that we may not award a bounty for very low-risk issues.
- We use the CVSS v4 framework to evaluate the criticality of issues and ensure a consistent risk assessment.
- We aim to reward similar vulnerabilities with comparable compensation; however, we also consider factors such as the time and effort required to discover the issue. Keep in mind that we may not match previous compensations for future reports.

## Disclosure Policy
Contact us at [security@qdrant.com](mailto:security@qdrant.com) to report vulnerabilities. Our security team will provide an initial response within 5 business days and triage the issue within 5-7 business days. We vary fix implementation timelines based on severity, and we process bounty payments after verifying the fix.

Follow these guidelines when disclosing vulnerabilities to us:
- Report any potential security vulnerabilities immediately upon discovery, as we commit to resolving issues swiftly.
- Maintain strict confidentiality regarding discovered vulnerabilities. Obtain explicit authorization from the Qdrant security team before publicly disclosing any vulnerabilities.
- Exercise caution to prevent data loss, privacy breaches, or service disruptions while conducting security research.
- Limit testing to your own accounts or those for which you have received explicit permission. Report any accidental access to unauthorized data immediately.
- **Safe Harbor:** We support ethical security research and promise not to initiate legal action against researchers who report vulnerabilities in good faith and comply with this disclosure policy. Ensure that your testing remains non-disruptive and respects the outlined guidelines so you qualify for Safe Harbor protections.
