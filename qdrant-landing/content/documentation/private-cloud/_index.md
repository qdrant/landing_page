# Qdrant Private Cloud

Qdrant Private Cloud allows you to manage Qdrant database clusters in any Kubernetes cluster on any infrastructure. It uses the same Qdrant Operator that powers Qdrant Managed Cloud and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, but without any connection to the Qdrant Cloud Management Console.

On top of the open source Qdrant database, it allows

* Easy deployment and management of Qdrant database clusters in your own Kubernetes infrastructure
* Zero-downtime upgrades of the Qdrant database with replication
* Vertical and horizontal up and downscaling of the Qdrant database with auto rebalancing and shard splitting
* Full control over scheduling, including Multi-AZ deployments
* Backup & Disaster Recovery
* Extended telemetry
* Qdrant Enterprise Support Services

If you are interested in using Qdrant Private Cloud, please [contact us](/contact-us/) for more information.
