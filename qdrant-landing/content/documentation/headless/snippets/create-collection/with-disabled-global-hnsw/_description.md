Configure Qdrant to optimize performance by bypassing the creation of a global vector index for the entire collection. Instead, focus on indexing vectors for individual groups separately to enhance the speed of the process. Update the HNSW configuration by setting `payload_m` to a specific value, like 16, and ensuring `m` in the configuration is set to 0 to disable the global index construction.
