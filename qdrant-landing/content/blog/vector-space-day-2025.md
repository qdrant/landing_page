## Vector Space Day 2025: Powered by Qdrant | Call for speakers now open

📍 Colosseum Berlin, Germany  
🗓️ Friday, September 26, 2025

### About

We’re hosting our first-ever full-day in-person [**Vector Space Day**](https://lu.ma/p7w9uqtz) this September in Berlin, and you’re invited.

The Vector Space Day will bring together engineers, researchers, and AI builders to explore the cutting edge of retrieval, vector search infrastructure, and agentic AI. From building scalable RAG pipelines to enabling real-time AI memory and next-gen context engineering, we’re covering the full spectrum of modern vector-native search.

### Why You Should Attend

* **Deep-dives & lightning talks**: Learn from the teams solving hard problems in AI infrastructure, search relevance, and semantic retrieval in production.  
* **Panels & debates**: Discuss the future of AI agents, multimodal memory, context-aware RAG, and vector-native developer workflows.   
* **Hands-on workshops**: Get practical with applied vector search and context construction in guided sessions, perfect whether you're building a search product or a complex RAG pipeline.  
* **Meet the community**: This isn’t just a conference. It’s a gathering of the developers rethinking how AI systems search, retrieve, and reason at scale.

### Topics We’ll Explore

We’re intentionally keeping things broad. If you work on any of the following, the Vector Space Day 2025 is your event:

* Vector databases & similarity search  
* AI memory and context management  
* Agent frameworks & orchestration  
* RAG pipelines & evaluation  
* Context engineering for retrieval & generation  
* Prompt construction and context window optimization  
* Real-time retrieval systems  
* Hybrid and semantic search at scale

Stay tuned: we’ll be announcing the full agenda, speaker lineup, and event partners in the coming weeks. Expect a mix of industry leaders, deep technical sessions, and emerging voices from the vector search and GenAI community.

### Call for Speakers

We’ve locked in a strong lineup but we’re saving a few select slots for standout talks from the community. If you’re building something novel in vector search, AI memory, context engineering, or retrieval infra, we want to hear from you.
