## What are MUVERA Embeddings?

Multi-vector representations are superior to single-vector embeddings in many benchmarks. It might be tempting to use 
them right away, but there is a catch: they are slower to search. Traditional vector search structures like 
[HNSW](/documentation/concepts/indexing/#vector-index) are optimized for retrieving the nearest neighbors of a single 
query vector using simple metrics such as cosine similarity. These indexes are not suitable for multi-vector retrieval 
strategies, such as MaxSim, where a query and document are each represented by multiple vectors and the final score is 
computed as the maximum similarity over all cross-pairings. MaxSim is inherently asymmetric and non-metric, so HNSW 
could potentially help us find the closest document token to a given query token, but that does not mean the whole 
document is the best hit for the query.

[MUVERA embeddings](https://research.google/blog/muvera-making-multi-vector-retrieval-as-fast-as-single-vector-search/),
introduced by Google Research, aim to solve this problem. The idea is to create a single vector that approximates the 
multi-vector representation. This single vector can be used for fast initial retrieval using traditional vector search 
methods, and then the multi-vector representation can be used for reranking the top results. This approach combines the 
speed of single-vector search with the accuracy of multi-vector retrieval. Reranking with multi-vector representations 
is much faster when applied to a small set of candidates rather than the entire dataset.

[FastEmbed 0.7.2 introduces support for MUVERA embeddings](#muvera-in-fastembed), and this article explains the concept 
in detail.

## How MUVERA Embeddings are created

**MUVERA** (**Mu**lti-**Ve**ctor **R**etrieval **A**lgorithm) transforms variable-length sequences of vectors into 
fixed-dimensional representations. Since the number of vectors in the input varies between documents and queries, and 
might be even different between different documents, we need a universal way to represent them in a fixed-size format.
Clustering the vector space of the tokens and projecting the individual multi-vector representations to 
a lower-dimensional space using the created clustering helps achieve this. The authors of the MUVERA paper suggest using 
the Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) technique called SimHash.

### Glossary of parameters

There are a few parameters that control the MUVERA embedding creation process, so in order to avoid confusion, here is 
a quick definition of them:

- `dim`: Dimensionality of a single token vector in the original multi-vector representation, depends on the model used
- `k_sim`: Number of random hyperplanes used in SimHash, which determines the number of clusters as `2^k_sim`
- `dim_proj`: Dimensionality of the projected vectors after random projection
- `r_reps`: Number of independent repetitions of the SimHash projection and random projection process

### SimHash projection for clustering

SimHash is one of the LSH techniques that uses random hyperplanes to hash input vectors into binary codes. In the first
step, this method chooses `k_sim` random hyperplanes (normal vectors) from a standard normal distribution. These 
hyperplanes divide the vector space into `2^k_sim` regions, because each vector can be on either side of each 
hyperplane. Here is how such a space division could look like for `k_sim=3`:

![SimHash space partitioning](/articles_data/muvera-embeddings/simhash-space-partitioning.png)

Each token vector is now assigned to one of these regions based on which side of each hyperplane it falls on. This is 
done by computing the dot product of the input vector with each hyperplane normal vector, and taking the sign of each 
result. Since each of our regions can be represented as a binary string of length `k_sim` (where each bit indicates 
which side of a hyperplane the vector is on), we can interpret this binary string as an integer to get a cluster ID.

![SimHash cluster assignement](/articles_data/muvera-embeddings/simhash-cluster-assignment.png)

### Fixed Dimensional Encoding (FDE) creation

Once all input vectors are assigned to clusters, we can aggregate the vectors belonging to each of the clusters. This 
process is slightly different for documents and queries. In both cases, we'll end up with a fixed-dimensional vector
with the same number of dimensions, but the way we compute these vectors differs.

#### Document clustering

Once we have assigned all the document token vectors to clusters, we compute the cluster centroids by averaging all 
vectors in each cluster. This gives us a representative vector for each cluster. If a cluster ends up being empty (i.e., 
no vectors were assigned to it), we fill it using vector from the nearest non-empty cluster. The distance between 
clusters is determined by the Hamming distance between their cluster IDs.

![FDE document processing](/articles_data/muvera-embeddings/fde-document-processing.png)

As a result we get `2^k_sim` vectors, each of them being `dim`-dimensional. 

#### Query clustering

Query processing is slightly different. Instead of computing the average vector for each cluster, we compute the sum of
all vectors in each cluster. This means that the resulting vectors will have larger magnitudes for clusters with more
assigned vectors. The idea is that it preserves the natural distribution of query terms, which can be beneficial for
retrieval. Unlike with documents, we do not fill empty clusters for queries. Queries are typically shorter than 
documents, so it's more likely that some clusters will be empty. Filling them could introduce noise and distort the
representation, as each term would contribute to the dot product multiple times.

![FDE query processing](/articles_data/muvera-embeddings/fde-query-processing.png)

Again, we end up with `2^k_sim` vectors of size `dim`. Because we do not fill empty clusters, some of these vectors 
might be zero vectors.

### Dimensionality reduction through Random Projection

The paper reports results from experiments with `k_sim` values of 4 and 5. Practically, this means 16 or 32 clusters,
respectively. If the original token vectors have a dimensionality of 128, the resulting FDE would have a dimensionality 
of `16 * 128 = 2048` or `32 * 128 = 4096`. However, a single SimHash projection with just 4 or 5 hyperplanes might not 
capture enough information about the input vectors. To improve the quality of the FDEs, the authors suggest repeating
the process multiple times with independent SimHash projections and concatenating the results. Practically, with 
`r_reps=20` repetitions, we would end up with FDEs of size `20 * 16 * 128 = 40960` or `20 * 32 * 128 = 81920`, which is 
quite large and could slow down single-vector search significantly. For that reason, the authors suggest applying random 
projection to reduce the dimensionality of each FDE. This involves multiplying each cluster vector by a random 
matrix with entries from `{-1, +1}` and applying a scaling factor of `1/√(dim_proj)`. This matrix has a shape of 
`(dim, dim_proj)`, where `dim_proj` is the desired dimensionality of the projected vectors. The resulting FDE will then 
have a size of `r_reps * 2^k_sim * dim_proj`.

![Random projection](/articles_data/muvera-embeddings/random-projection.png)

The results from all repetitions are then concatenated to form the final FDE. This repetition helps to create a more 
robust representation that better approximates the original multi-vector embedding.

### Final random projection

The original paper suggests applying an additional random projection to the final FDE to further reduce its 
dimensionality. It is an optional step that can be used if the resulting FDE is still too large. This final projection 
uses another random matrix with entries from `{-1, +1}` to project the FDE to a desired lower dimensionality.

## Practical considerations

MUVERA embeddings seem to be a promising approach to make multi-vector retrieval more efficient. The paper **recommends
using it as an initial retrieval step followed by reranking with the original multi-vector representation**. This 
approach requires storing both the MUVERA embeddings and the original multi-vector representations, which increases 
storage requirements.

Please note that the MUVERA embeddings might be way larger than the single dense vectors produced by traditional
embedding models you might be used to. For example, using `k_sim=6` (64 clusters), `dim_proj=32`, and `r_reps=20` with 
128-dimensional token vectors results in FDEs of size `20 * 64 * 32 = 40960`. This is significantly larger than typical 
single-vector embeddings, which are around a few thousand dimensions at most. The increased size of MUVERA embeddings 
can impact storage and retrieval efficiency, so it's important to consider these factors when deciding to use them.

### Impact on search performance

To evaluate the effectiveness of MUVERA embeddings, we benchmarked three different approaches on the BeIR nfcorpus 
dataset using the ColBERTv2 model. The MUVERA configuration used the following parameters: `k_sim=5`, `dim_proj=16`, 
and `r_reps=20`:

| Approach                    | NDCG@1 | NDCG@5 | NDCG@10 |
|-----------------------------|--------|--------|---------|
| Full multi-vector (ColBERT) | 0.478  | 0.387  | 0.347   |
| MUVERA-only                 | 0.319  | 0.267  | 0.242   |
| MUVERA + reranking          | 0.475  | 0.383  | 0.343   |

The results show that MUVERA-only search trades some accuracy for speed, achieving about 70% of the full multi-vector 
performance. However, using MUVERA for initial retrieval followed by multi-vector reranking recovers nearly all the 
original performance while maintaining the efficiency benefits for the initial search phase.

It's becoming especially interesting when you consider the search latency improvements. In our benchmarks, we observed 
significant speed gains:

| Approach                    | Average Search Time (seconds) |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Full multi-vector (ColBERT) | 1.27                          |
| MUVERA-only                 | 0.15                          |
| MUVERA + reranking          | 0.18                          |

MUVERA-only search is approximately 8x faster than full multi-vector search, while the hybrid approach with reranking 
still achieves about 7x speed improvement while maintaining nearly identical search quality.
