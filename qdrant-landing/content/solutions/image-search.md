    Find similar images, detect duplicates, or even find a picture by text description - all of that you can do with Qdrant.
    Mostly you won't even need to train a neural network for that. Pre-trained models are usually enough to begin with. 
    Check out our [demo](https://food-discovery.qdrant.tech/)!

Sometimes text search is not enough. 

Qdrant allows you to find similar images, detect duplicates, or even find a picture by text description.
No need to train your own neural network, get started with pre-trained models. 

Qdrant filters enable you to apply arbitrary business logic on top of a similarity search.
Look for similar clothes cheaper than $20? Search for a similar artwork published in the last year?
Qdrant handles all possible conditions!

For the Demo, we put together a food discovery service - it will show you a lunch suggestion based on what you visually like or dislike. It can also search for a place near you.
