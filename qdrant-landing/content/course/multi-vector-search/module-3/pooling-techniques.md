# Pooling Techniques

While quantization reduces the size of each vector, pooling reduces the number of vectors per document. By intelligently combining token embeddings, you can achieve significant memory savings while preserving retrieval quality.

Pooling is particularly effective when combined with quantization for maximum memory efficiency.
