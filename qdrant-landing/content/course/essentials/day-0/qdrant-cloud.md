Spin up production-grade vector search in minutes. Qdrant Cloud gives you a managed endpoint with TLS, automatic backups, high-availability options, and a clean API.

## Create your cluster

1. Sign up at [cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io/signup) with email, Google, or GitHub.
2. Open **Clusters** → **Create a Free Cluster**. The Free Tier is enough for this course.

![Create cluster](/docs/gettingstarted/gui-quickstart/create-cluster.png)

3. Pick a region close to your users or app.
4. When the cluster is ready, copy the API key and store it securely. You can make new keys later from **API Keys** on the cluster page.

## Access the Web UI

1. Click **Cluster UI** in the top-right of the cluster page to open the dashboard.

### What you can do in the Web UI

Use the Web UI to manage collections, inspect data, and debug search performance.

#### Main Navigation

**Console**: Run REST calls in the browser. Test endpoints, inspect responses, and debug queries without writing code. Handy for exploring the full API.

**Collections**: See and manage all collections. Create collections, upload snapshots, and track status, size, and configuration at a glance.

**Tutorial**: Follow an interactive walkthrough with sample data. Create a collection, add vectors, and run semantic search with live results.

**Datasets**: Bulk-load preconfigured public datasets into your cluster.

#### Inside a Collection

When you open a collection by clicking it's name,

![Select collection](/docs/gettingstarted/gui-quickstart/select-collection.png)

you’ll get a detailed view with these tabs:

![Collection points](/docs/gettingstarted/gui-quickstart/collection-points.png)

* **Points Tab**: Inspect, search, and manage individual points. Use the search bar to find by ID or filter by payload fields (e.g., `colony: "Mars"`). For each point, you can:

  * See its payload and vector(s).
  * Click **Find Similar** to run an ad-hoc similarity search.
  * Click **Open Graph** to jump to a graph view of its HNSW connections.

* **Info Tab**: Get a full overview of collection health, config, and stats. Key fields:

  * `status`: `green` means healthy.
  * `points_count`: Number of active points.
  * `indexed_vectors_count`: Points currently in the HNSW index. If this lags behind `points_count`, background indexing is still running.
  * `config`: JSON view of all parameters, from vector settings to optimizer options.

* **Cluster Tab**: See how shards are placed across nodes. Use it to monitor health, find hot spots, and verify shard placement in distributed setups.

* **Search Quality Tab**: Evaluate and benchmark retrieval precision against ground truth. Tune parameters and measure the impact on accuracy.

* **Snapshots Tab**: Manage backups for this collection. Create a [snapshot](/documentation/concepts/snapshots/), restore it later, or migrate it to another cluster.

* **Visualize Tab**: Explore your vector space with an interactive 2D projection. See clusters, spot outliers, and build intuition about your embeddings.

* **Graph Tab**: Explore the HNSW graph interactively. Start from any point, follow nearest neighbors, and see how the graph structure powers fast search.

## Connect from Python

Store credentials in an `.env` file at the root of your working directory:

```env
QDRANT_URL=https://YOUR-CLUSTER.cloud.qdrant.io:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Load the credentials with `dotenv` and create a Qdrant client:

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

load_dotenv()
client = QdrantClient(
    url=os.getenv("QDRANT_URL"),
    api_key=os.getenv("QDRANT_API_KEY"),
)

# Quick health check
collections = client.get_collections()
print(f"Connected to Qdrant Cloud: {len(collections.collections)} collections")
```

## Other ways to connect

You can also send your key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
# Using api-key header
curl -X GET https://xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333/collections \
  --header 'api-key: <your-api-key>'

# Using Authorization header  
curl -X GET https://xyz-example.eu-central.aws.cloud.qdrant.io:6333/collections \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>'
```

## Quick validation

Check basic connectivity:

```bash
# Service health
curl -s "$QDRANT_URL/healthz" -H "api-key: $QDRANT_API_KEY"

# List collections
curl -s "$QDRANT_URL/collections" -H "api-key: $QDRANT_API_KEY"
```

## Good practices

* Keep secrets out of code; use environment variables or a secret manager.
* Restrict access with IP allow-lists or private networking.
* Rotate API keys regularly from the cluster **Access** tab.
* Use HTTPS only; turn on RBAC and strict limits when exposing endpoints to untrusted clients.

## Common issues

* **Authentication error**: Recheck the API key and the `api-key` header.
* **Connection error**: Confirm cluster status and region URL; some corporate proxies block outbound TLS.

## Qdrant Cloud Inference

Qdrant Cloud also offers **[Cloud Inference](/cloud-inference/)**—managed embedding generation for text and images. Skip running your own embedding models; create vectors in Qdrant Cloud and write them straight into your collections.

Cut steps from your pipeline: send raw text or images to Qdrant, get vectors and search results in one API call. This helps prototypes and production systems alike by ending the separate embedding-infrastructure layer.
