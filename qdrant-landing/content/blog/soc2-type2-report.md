At Qdrant, we are happy to announce the successful completion our the SOC 2 Type II Audit. This achievement underscores our unwavering commitment to upholding the highest standards of security, availability, and confidentiality for our services and our customers’ data.


## SOC 2 Type II: What Is It?

SOC 2 Type II certification is an examination of an organization's controls in reference to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants [(AICPA) Trust Services criteria](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/resources/download/2017-trust-services-criteria-with-revised-points-of-focus-2022). It evaluates not only our written policies but also their practical implementation, ensuring alignment between our stated objectives and operational practices. Unlike Type I, which is a snapshot in time, Type II verifies over several months that the company has lived up to those controls. The report represents thorough auditing of our security procedures throughout this examination period: January 1, 2024 to April 7, 2024. 


## Key Audit Findings

The audit ensured with no exceptions noted the effectiveness of our systems and controls on the following Trust Service Criteria:



* Security
* Confidentiality
* Availability

These certifications are available today and automatically apply to your existing workloads. The full SOC 2 Type II report is available to customers and stakeholders upon request through the [Trust Center](https://app.drata.com/trust/9cbbb75b-0c38-11ee-865f-029d78a187d9).


## Future Compliance

Going forward, Qdrant will maintain SOC 2 Type II compliance by conducting continuous, annual audits to ensure our security practices remain aligned with industry standards and evolving risks. 

Recognizing the critical importance of data security and the trust our clients place in us, achieving SOC 2 Type II compliance underscores our ongoing commitment to prioritize data protection with the utmost integrity and reliability.
