This code snippet represents a geo polygon filter condition for location data. It defines an irregularly shaped area with an exterior boundary and an optional interior boundary. The exterior boundary is specified with a sequence of points, while the interior boundary is also defined with a separate sequence of points. The code uses longitude and latitude coordinates to create the geo polygon, offering a way to filter points based on their location within the specified polygon.
