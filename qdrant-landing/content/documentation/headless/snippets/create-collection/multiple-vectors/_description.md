This code defines a collection with the ability to store multiple vectors per record. Each vector, such as 'image' and 'text', has a unique name and is associated with specific distance and size parameters. The 'image' vector has a size of 4 and a distance metric of 'Dot', while the 'text' vector has a size of 8 and a distance metric of 'Cosine'. This feature enables the storage of different types of vectors within the same collection.
