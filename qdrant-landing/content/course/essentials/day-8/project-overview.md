# Final Project: Documentation Search Engine

{{< youtube "YOUR_YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE" >}}

It's time to synthesize everything you've learned into a portfolio-ready application. You'll build a sophisticated documentation search engine that demonstrates hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, and production-quality evaluation - all in a single Jupyter notebook.

<br/>

## Project Vision

Your search engine will understand both semantic meaning and exact keywords, then use fine-grained reranking to surface the most relevant documentation sections. When someone searches for "how to configure HNSW parameters," your system should return the exact section with practical examples, not just a page that mentions [HNSW](https://qdrant.tech/articles/filtrable-hnsw/) somewhere.

This mirrors real-world retrieval challenges where users need precise answers from large documentation sets. You'll implement the complete pipeline: ingestion with smart chunking, hybrid search with dense and sparse signals, and multivector reranking for precision.

## Technical Architecture

Your system will use three complementary vector representations:

**Dense vectors** provide semantic understanding - they capture the meaning and context of documentation sections, enabling searches like "vector similarity concepts" to find relevant content even when exact terms don't match.

**Sparse vectors** ensure keyword precision - they preserve exact term matching so searches for specific API names, configuration parameters, or technical terms return the right sections reliably.

**Multivectors** enable fine-grained reranking - token-level representations that can distinguish between sections with similar topics but different quality or relevance for the specific query.

## Implementation Strategy

### Collection Design

Create one collection with three vector fields optimized for different roles:

```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="docs_search",
    vectors_config={
        "dense": models.VectorParams(size=384, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
        "colbert": models.VectorParams(
            size=128,
            distance=models.Distance.COSINE,
            multivector_config=models.MultiVectorConfig(
                comparator=models.MultiVectorComparator.MAX_SIM
            ),
            hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(m=0)  # Reranking only
        )
    },
    sparse_vectors_config={
        "sparse": models.SparseVectorParams()
    }
)
```

### Recommended Models

**Dense (Primary Retrieval)**: Use `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` for speed or `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` for higher quality. For multilingual documentation, consider `intfloat/multilingual-e5-base`.

**Multivector (Reranking)**: Implement late-interaction scoring with ColBERT or ColBERTv2. This provides token-level precision for distinguishing between similar sections.

**Sparse (Lexical)**: Start with BM25-style sparse weights for exact keyword matching. Optionally experiment with SPLADE encoders for stronger lexical recall.

### Chunking Strategy

Chunk by documentation structure, not arbitrary token windows:

**Primary unit**: One chunk per section, preserving the natural boundaries of how documentation is written and how users think about topics.

**Context preservation**: Store adjacent sections in payload fields (`prev_section_text`, `next_section_text`) for reranking context without diluting the primary embedding.

**Metadata retention**: Capture `section_title`, `page_title`, breadcrumbs, and anchors to enable precise result attribution and user navigation.

### Search Pipeline

**Stage 1 - Hybrid Retrieval**: Combine dense semantic search with sparse keyword matching using server-side fusion (RRF or DBSF). Retrieve 50-200 candidates to ensure good recall.

**Stage 2 - Multivector Reranking**: Apply token-level late interaction scoring to the candidate set, using MAX_SIM aggregation to find the best token alignments between query and documentation sections.

**Result Assembly**: Return page title, section title, URLs, scores, and contextual snippets that help users understand why each result is relevant.

## Evaluation Framework

Build a rigorous evaluation system that measures real search quality:

**Ground Truth**: Create 20-30 realistic queries with expected documentation URLs and anchors. Focus on queries that real users would ask.

**Metrics to Track**:
- **Recall@10**: Does the correct section appear in the top 10 results?
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: How far down is the first correct result?
- **Latency P50/P95**: End-to-end search performance under realistic conditions

**Quality Targets**: Aim for Recall@10 ≥ 0.8 on your test set. This demonstrates that your system finds the right answer in the top 10 results for 80% of queries.

## Key Design Decisions

You'll make several critical choices that affect system performance:

**Chunking granularity**: Balance between chunks large enough to contain complete answers and small enough to maintain precision.

**Payload design**: Include fields that enable result attribution, filtering, and evaluation without bloating storage.

**Fusion strategy**: Choose between RRF and DBSF for combining dense and sparse results, and tune the candidate set size.

**Reranking approach**: Decide which text views go into your multivector and how to aggregate token-level scores.

**Performance tuning**: Optimize HNSW parameters (`ef`, `m`, `ef_construct`) and search parameters for your accuracy and latency requirements.
