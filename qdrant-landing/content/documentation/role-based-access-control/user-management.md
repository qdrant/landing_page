# User Management

## Inviting Users to an Account

Users can be invited through the **User Management** section, where they are assigned the **Base role** by default upon acceptance. Additionally, users have the option to select a specific role when inviting another user. The **Base role** is a predefined role with minimal permissions, granting users access to the platform while restricting them to viewing only their own profile.

### **Inviting Users from a Role**

Users can be invited attached to a specific role by inviting them through the **Role Details** page - just click on the Users tab and follow the prompts. 

Once accepted, they'll gain access with that role's permissions, along with any base role they may already have.

### Revoking an Invitation

Before being accepted, an account Admin/Owner can cancel a pending invite directly on either the **User Management** or **Role Details** page to which the user was invited.

## Updating a User’s Roles

Account admins/owners with permission can give or take away roles from users in **User Management**.

## Removing a User from an Account

Users can be removed from an account by clicking on their name in either **User Management** (via Actions). This option is only available after they've accepted the invitation to join, ensuring that only active users can be removed.
