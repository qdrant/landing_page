We've released the new version of Qdrant engine - v.0.9.0. It features the dynamic cluster scaling capabilities. Now Qdrant is more flexible with cluster deployment, allowing to move shards between nodes and remove nodes from the cluster.

v.0.9.0 also has various improvements, such as removing temporary snapshot files during the complete snapshot, disabling default mmap threshold, and more.
