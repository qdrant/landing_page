This code snippet is a request to retrieve facet counts for a specific key within a collection. The response will contain values sorted by count in descending order and then by value in ascending order. It specifies that only values with non-zero counts will be included in the results. By setting the `exact` parameter to `true`, it ensures that the counts returned are precise instead of approximate, which is useful for debugging storage or when an exact count is needed.
