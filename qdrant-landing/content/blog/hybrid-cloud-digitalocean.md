In the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), developers are constantly seeking new ways to enhance their applications with new customer experiences. At the core of this are vector databases, as they enable the efficient handling of complex, unstructured data, making it possible to power applications with semantic search, personalized recommendation systems, and intelligent Q&A platforms. However, when deploying such new AI applications, especially those handling sensitive or personal user data, privacy becomes important.

[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and Qdrant are actively addressing this with an integration that let’s developers deploy a managed vector database directly in their existing DigitalOcean environments. With the launch of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud developers can seamlessly deploy Qdrant on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters, making it easier for developers to handle vector databases without getting bogged down in the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.

#### Unlocking the Power of Generative AI for DigitalOcean Customers with Qdrant

User data is a critical asset for a business, and user privacy should always be a top priority. This is why businesses require tools that enable them to leverage their user data as a valuable asset while respecting privacy. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on DigitalOcean brings these capabilities directly into developers' hands, enhancing deployment flexibility and ensuring greater control over data.

> *“Qdrant, with its seamless integration and robust performance, equips businesses to develop cutting-edge applications that truly resonate with their users. Through applications such as semantic search, Q&A systems, recommendation engines, image search, and RAG, DigitalOcean customers can leverage their data to the fullest, ensuring privacy and driving innovation.“* - Bikram Gupta, Lead Product Manager, Kubernetes & App Platform, DigitalOcean.

#### Get Started with Qdrant on DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean customers can easily deploy Qdrant on their DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) clusters through a simple Kubernetis-native “One-line” installment. This simplicity allows businesses to start small and scale efficiently.

- **Simple Deployment**: Leveraging Kubernetes, deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on DigitalOcean is streamlined, making the management of vector search workloads in the own environment more efficient.

- **Own Infrastructure**: Hosting the vector database on your own DigitalOcean infrastructure in a managed way, provides flexibility and allows you to manage the full AI stack in one place.

- **Data Control**: Deploying within the own DigitalOcean environment ensures data control, keeping sensitive information within the own security perimeter.

To get Qdrant Hybrid Cloud setup on DigitalOcean, just follow these steps:

- **Hybrid Cloud Setup**: Begin by logging into your [Qdrant Cloud account](https://cloud.qdrant.io/login) and enable the 'Hybrid Cloud' feature.

- **Cluster Configuration**: Go to the Hybrid Cloud settings and integrate your DigitalOcean Kubernetes clusters as a Hybrid Cloud Environment.

- **Simplified Deployment**: Use the Qdrant Management Console to effortlessly establish and oversee your Qdrant clusters on DigitalOcean.

We created a tutorial that guides you through setting up and leveraging Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on DigitalOcean for a RAG application. It highlights practical steps to integrate vector search with Jina AI's LLMs, optimizing the generation of high-quality, relevant AI content, while ensuring data sovereignty is maintained throughout. This specific system is tied together via the LlamaIndex framework.
