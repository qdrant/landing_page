# Qdrant Cloud Premium Tier

Qdrant Cloud offers an optional premium tier for customers who require additional features and better SLA support levels. The premium tier includes:

* **24/7 Support**: Our support team is available around the clock to help you with any issues you may encounter (compared to 10x5 in standard).
* **Shorter Response Times**: Premium customers receive priority support and can expect faster response times, with shorter SLAs.
* **99.9% Uptime SLA**: We guarantee 99.9% uptime for your Qdrant Cloud clusters (compared to 99.5% in standard).
* **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Premium customers can use their existing SSO provider to manage access to Qdrant Cloud.
* **VPC Private Links**: Premium customers can connect their Qdrant Cloud clusters to their VPCs using private links (AWS only).
* **Storage encryption with shared keys**: Premium customers can encrypt their data at rest using their own keys (AWS only).

Please refer to the [Qdrant Cloud SLA](https://qdrant.to/sla/) for a detailed definition on uptime and support SLAs.
