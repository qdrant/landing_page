  text: Go ahead and checkout Qdrant. I plan to build a movie retrieval search where you can ask anything regarding a movie based on the vector embeddings generated by a LLM. It can also be used for getting recommendations.

  text: We have been using Qdrant in production now for over 6 months to store vectors for cosine similarity search and it is way more stable and faster than our old ElasticSearch vector index.<br/><br/>No merging segments, no red indexes at random times. It just works and was super easy to deploy via docker to our cluster.<br/><br/>It’s faster, cheaper to host, and more stable, and open source to boot!

  text: Amidst the hype around vector databases, Qdrant is by far my favorite one. It's super fast (written in Rust) and open-source! At Kern AI we use Qdrant for fast document retrieval and to do quick similarity search for text data.
