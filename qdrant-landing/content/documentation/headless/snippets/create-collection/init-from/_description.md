Description: This code snippet demonstrates creating a new collection by initializing it from an existing collection. The new collection will inherit the vector settings, such as size and distance function, from the source collection specified in the `init_from` field. It is a convenient feature for testing different configurations quickly. However, caution is advised as using `init_from` may lead to unpredictable load on the cluster, especially in performance-sensitive environments. Make sure that the vectors in both collections have matching settings for size and distance function.
