This code snippet illustrates how to use the Jina AI API for ingest-time inference on Qdrant Cloud. The example upserts a point, but instead of providing an explicit vector, the request includes text along with the name of a Jina AI model. When the model name is prepended with `jinaai/`, the Qdrant Cloud Inference proxy uses the Jina AI API to infer embeddings out of the provided text. Qdrant will store the resulting vector. The request also shows how to pass Jina AI-specific parameters to the API. In this case, the request provides the Jina AI API key and the `dimensions` parameter.
