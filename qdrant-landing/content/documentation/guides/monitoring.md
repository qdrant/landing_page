# Monitoring & Telemetry

Qdrant exposes its metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/#text-based-format)/[OpenMetrics](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics) format, so you can integrate them easily
with the compatible tools and monitor Qdrant with your own monitoring system. You can
use the `/metrics` endpoint and configure it as a scrape target.

Metrics endpoint: <http://localhost:6333/metrics>

The integration with Qdrant is easy to
[configure](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/#configure-prometheus-to-monitor-the-sample-targets)
with Prometheus and Grafana.

## Monitoring multi-node clusters

When scraping metrics from multi-node Qdrant clusters, it is important to scrape from
each node individually instead of using a load-balanced URL. Otherwise, your metrics will appear inconsistent after each scrape.

## Monitoring in Qdrant Cloud

To scrape metrics from a Qdrant cluster running in Qdrant Cloud, note that an [API key](/documentation/cloud/authentication/) is required to access `/metrics`. Qdrant Cloud also supports supplying the API key as a [Bearer token](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html), which may be required by some providers.

## Exposed metrics

Each Qdrant server will expose the following metrics.

### Cluster-related metrics

There are also some metrics which are exposed in distributed mode only.

## Telemetry endpoint

Qdrant also provides a `/telemetry` endpoint, which provides information about the current state of the database, including the number of vectors, shards, and other useful information. You can find a full documentation of this endpoint in the [API reference](https://api.qdrant.tech/api-reference/service/telemetry).

## Kubernetes health endpoints

*Available as of v1.5.0*

Qdrant exposes three endpoints, namely
[`/healthz`](http://localhost:6333/healthz),
[`/livez`](http://localhost:6333/livez) and
[`/readyz`](http://localhost:6333/readyz), to indicate the current status of the
Qdrant server.

These currently provide the most basic status response, returning HTTP 200 if
Qdrant is started and ready to be used.

Regardless of whether an [API key](/documentation/guides/security/#authentication) is configured,
the endpoints are always accessible.

You can read more about Kubernetes health endpoints
[here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/health-checks/).
