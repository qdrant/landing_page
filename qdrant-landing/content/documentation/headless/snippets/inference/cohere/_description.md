This code snippet demonstrates how to use the Cohere API for inference on Qdrant Cloud. The example first creates a collection that supports vectors with 512 dimensions. Next, a point is inserted, but instead of providing an explicit vector, the example request includes text along with the name of an Cohere model. When the model name is prepended with `cohere/`, the Qdrant Cloud Inference proxy will use the Cohere API to infer embeddings out of the provided text and store the resulting vector. The request also shows how to pass Cohere-specific parameters to the API. In this case, the request passes the Cohere API key and the `dimensions` parameter. Finally, the example shows how to use the Cohere API for query-time inference. Instead of supplying an explicit query vector, the query includes text and name of an Cohere model, as well as an Cohere API key and the Cohere-specific `dimensions` parameter. When the model name is prepended with `cohere/`, the Qdrant Cloud Inference proxy will use the Cohere API to infer embeddings out of the provided text and search with the resulting vector.
