This code snippet uses the Qdrant and FastEmbed integration to infer and upsert documents into a collection configured for miniCOIL sparse vectors. Each document is converted into a sparse miniCOIL vector, with the conversion incorporating the avg_len parameter of the BM25-based miniCOIL scoring formula — the average document length in the corpus — which must be provided by the user. The resulting vector and the document’s text, stored as payload, are then upserted to the collection.
