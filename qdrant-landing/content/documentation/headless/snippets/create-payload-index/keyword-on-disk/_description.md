Creates a payload index for a specified collection and field name with a keyword type that is stored on disk. Storing the payload index on disk allows for efficient access to payload values during search, especially for cases where the payload indexes are large or rarely used. However, it's important to note that storing payload indexes on disk may impact the latency of cold requests due to additional disk I/O operations.
