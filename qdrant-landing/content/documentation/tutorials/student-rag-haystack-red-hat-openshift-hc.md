# Private Chatbot for Interactive Learning

| Time: 120 min | Level: Advanced | Output: [GitHub](https://github.com/qdrant/) |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |----------- |

Having already completed their online training, corporate employees might want to refer back old course materials. Most of this information is proprietary to the company, and manually searching through an entire library of materials takes time. However, a chatbot built on this knowledge can respond in the blink of an eye. 

With a simple RAG pipeline, you can build a private chatbot. In this tutorial, you will combine open source tools inside of a closed infrastructure and tie them together with a reliable framework. This custom solution lets you run a chatbot without public internet access. You will be able to keep sensitive data secure without compromising privacy.

![OpenShift](/documentation/tutorials/student-rag-haystack-red-hat-openshift-hc/openshift-diagram.png)
**Figure 1:** The LLM and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud are containerized as separate services. Haystack combines them into a RAG pipeline and exposes the API via Hayhooks.

## Components
To maintain complete data isolation, we need to limit ourselves to open-source tools and use them in a private environment, such as [Red Hat OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift). The pipeline will run internally and will be inaccessible from the internet.

- **Dataset:** [Red Hat Interactive Learning Portal](https://developers.redhat.com/learn), an online library of RedHat course materials.
- **LLM:** `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`, deployed as a standalone service on OpenShift.
- **Embedding Model:** `BAAI/bge-m3`, lightweight LLM deployed from within the Haystack pipeline.
- **Vector DB:** [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech) running on OpenShift.
- **Framework:** [Haystack 2.x](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) to connect all and [Hayhooks](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hayhooks) to serve the app through HTTP endpoints.

### Procedure
The [Haystack](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) framework leverages two pipelines, which combine our components sequentially to process data. 

1. The **Indexing Pipeline** will run offline in batches, when new data is added or updated. 
2. The **Search Pipeline** will retrieve information from Qdrant and use an LLM to produce an answer.

> **Note:** We will define the pipelines in Python and then export them to YAML format, so that [Hayhooks](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/hayhooks) can run them as a web service.

## Prerequisites

### Deploy the LLM to OpenShift

Follow the steps in [Chapter 6. Serving large language models](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.5/html/working_on_data_science_projects/serving-large-language-models_serving-large-language-models#doc-wrapper). This will download the LLM from the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1), and deploy it to OpenShift using a *single model serving platform*. 

Your LLM service will have a URL, which you need to store as an environment variable.

```shell
export INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_URL="http://mistral-service.default.svc.cluster.local"
```

```python
import os

os.environ["INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_URL"] = "http://mistral-service.default.svc.cluster.local"
```

### Launch Qdrant Hybrid Cloud

Complete **How to Set Up Qdrant on RedHat OpenShift**. When in Hybrid Cloud, your Qdrant instance is private and and its nodes run on the same OpenShift infrastructure as your other components.  

Retrieve your Qdrant URL and API key and store them as environment variables:

```shell
export QDRANT_URL="https://qdrant.example.com"
export QDRANT_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```python
os.environ["QDRANT_URL"] = "https://qdrant.example.com"
os.environ["QDRANT_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```
## Implementation

We will first create an indexing pipeline to add documents to the system. 
Then, the search pipeline will retrieve relevant data from our documents.
After the pipelines are tested, we will export them to YAML files.

### Indexing pipeline

[Haystack 2.x](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) comes packed with a lot of useful components, from data fetching, through 
HTML parsing, up to the vector storage. Before we start, there are a few Python packages that we need to install:

```shell
pip install haystack-ai \
  qdrant-haystack \
  transformers \
  torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

<aside role="status">
We set the index URL for PyTorch to CPU, as we are going to run the indexing process, including the embedding model, on 
the processor. If you have a compatible GPU, you can install the corresponding version of PyTorch (CUDA or ROCm).
</aside>

Our environment is now ready, so we can jump right into the code. Let's define an empty pipeline and gradually add
components to it:

```python
from haystack import Pipeline

indexing_pipeline = Pipeline()
```

#### Data fetching and conversion

Our goal is to have a tool that will accept a list of URLs, download the content from them and store in Qdrant to enable
searching over it. We also don't want to store the raw HTML, but extract the text content from each webpage. Also, the
documents might be pretty long, so it's better to divide them into digestible chunks. We can achieve all of that with
the components provided by Haystack. First of all, let's focus on the data fetching and conversion to text:

```python
from haystack.components.fetchers import LinkContentFetcher
from haystack.components.converters import HTMLToDocument

fetcher = LinkContentFetcher()
converter = HTMLToDocument()

indexing_pipeline.add_component("fetcher", fetcher)
indexing_pipeline.add_component("converter", converter)
```

Our pipeline knows there are two components, but they are not connected yet. We need to define the flow between them:

```python
indexing_pipeline.connect("fetcher.streams", "converter.sources")
```

Each component has a set of inputs and outputs which might be combined in a directed graph. The definitions of the 
inputs and outputs are usually provided in the documentation of the component. The `LinkContentFetcher` has the 
following parameters:

![Parameters of the `LinkContentFetcher`](/documentation/tutorials/student-rag-haystack-red-hat-openshift-hc/haystack-link-content-fetcher.png)

*Source: https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/linkcontentfetcher*

#### Chunking and creating the embeddings

The `HTMLToDocument` component was used to convert the HTML sources into `Document` instances of Haystack, which is a
base class containing some data to be queried. Still, a single document might be too long to be processed by the 
embedding model, and it also carries way too much information to make the search relevant. We need to split the document
into smaller parts and convert them into embeddings. For that purpose, we will use the `DocumentSplitter` and
`HuggingFaceTEIDocumentEmbedder` pointed to our `BAAI/bge-m3` model:

```python
from haystack.components.preprocessors import DocumentSplitter
from haystack.components.embedders import HuggingFaceTEIDocumentEmbedder

splitter = DocumentSplitter(split_by="sentence", split_length=5, split_overlap=2)
embedder = HuggingFaceTEIDocumentEmbedder(model="BAAI/bge-m3")

indexing_pipeline.add_component("splitter", splitter)
indexing_pipeline.add_component("embedder", embedder)

indexing_pipeline.connect("converter.documents", "splitter.documents")
indexing_pipeline.connect("splitter.documents", "embedder.documents")
```

#### Writing data to Qdrant

The splitter will be producing chunks with a maximum length of 5 sentences, with an overlap of 2 sentences. Then, these
smaller portions will be converted into embeddings. The last missing piece is the storage of the embeddings in Qdrant.

```python
from haystack.utils import Secret
from haystack_integrations.document_stores.qdrant import QdrantDocumentStore
from haystack.components.writers import DocumentWriter

document_store = QdrantDocumentStore(
    os.environ["QDRANT_URL"], 
    api_key=Secret.from_env_var("QDRANT_API_KEY"),
    index="red-hat-learning", 
    return_embedding=True, 
    embedding_dim=1024,
)
writer = DocumentWriter(document_store=document_store)

indexing_pipeline.add_component("writer", writer)

indexing_pipeline.connect("embedder.documents", "writer.documents")
```

Our pipeline is now complete. Haystack comes with a handy visualization of the pipeline, so you can see and verify the 
connections between the components. It is displayed in the Jupyter notebook, but you can also export it to a file:

```python
indexing_pipeline.draw("indexing_pipeline.png")
```

![Structure of the indexing pipeline](/documentation/tutorials/student-rag-haystack-red-hat-openshift-hc/indexing_pipeline.png)

#### Test the entire pipeline 

We can finally run it on a list of URLs to index the content in Qdrant. We have a bunch of URLs to all the Red Hat
OpenShift Foundations course lessons, so let's use them:

```python
course_urls = [
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learn/openshift/foundations-openshift",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:openshift-and-developer-sandbox",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:overview-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:use-terminal-window-within-red-hat-openshift-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:install-application-source-code-github-repository-using-openshift-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:install-application-linux-container-image-repository-using-openshift-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:install-application-linux-container-image-using-oc-cli-tool",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:install-application-source-code-using-oc-cli-tool",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:scale-applications-using-openshift-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:scale-applications-using-oc-cli-tool",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:work-databases-openshift-using-oc-cli-tool",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:work-databases-openshift-web-console",
    "https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:view-performance-information-using-openshift-web-console",
]

indexing_pipeline.run(data={
    "fetcher": {
        "urls": course_urls,
    }
})
```

The execution might take a while, as the model needs to process all the documents. After the process is finished, we
should have all the documents stored in Qdrant, ready to be searched over and a short summary should be displayed on
the standard output:

```shell
{'writer': {'documents_written': 381}}
```

### Search pipeline

Our documents are now indexed, and ready for search. The next pipeline is a bit simpler, but still requires a
few components to be defined. Let's start again with an empty pipeline:

```python
search_pipeline = Pipeline()
```

Our second process takes user's input, converts it into embeddings, and then searches for the most relevant documents
using the query embedding. Up to this point, it may look similar, but here we don't work with `Document` instances 
anymore, but just raw text sent as a query. Thus, some of the components will be different, especially the embedder,
as it has to accept a single string as an input and produce a single embedding as an output:

```python
from haystack.components.embedders import HuggingFaceTEITextEmbedder
from haystack_integrations.components.retrievers.qdrant import QdrantEmbeddingRetriever

query_embedder = HuggingFaceTEITextEmbedder(model="BAAI/bge-m3")
retriever = QdrantEmbeddingRetriever(
    document_store=document_store,  # The same document store as the one used for indexing
    top_k=3,  # Number of documents to return
)

search_pipeline.add_component("query_embedder", query_embedder)
search_pipeline.add_component("retriever", retriever)

search_pipeline.connect("query_embedder.embedding", "retriever.query_embedding")
```

#### Run a test query

If our goal was to just retrieve the relevant documents, we could stop here. Let's try the current pipeline on a simple
query:

```python
query = "How to install an application using the OpenShift web console?"

search_pipeline.run(data={
    "query_embedder": {
        "text": query
    }
})
```

We set the `top_k` parameter to 3, so the retriever should return the three most relevant documents. The output should
look as follows:

```text
{
  'retriever': {
    'documents': [
      Document(id=d127499a751f01969e76874049de7bea2dae077184eed9129d98fc97844c4bf2, content: '  Enter the application’s name (Figure 8).

      Document(id=59095a8e45e656ec7ead299907407c9e63819813ec4a044fb33d953f79448437, content: 'For example, OpenShift lets you install a web application directly from source code or from a conta...', meta: {'content_type': 'text/html', 'source_id': '97f3aed6ff6712d980d6a501def31752317134eabc9897f900f9e2190fbbe186', 'url': 'https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:openshift:foundations-openshift/resource/resources:openshift-and-developer-sandbox'}, score: 0.8763400299999999),

    ]
  }
}
```

#### Generating the answer

We don't want just the documents, but also an exact answer to our question. For that purpose, we need to use the Large
Language Model to generate it. That will be the final component of our second pipeline, but there is also a need to 
create a prompt that will take the documents and put it into the context sent to the LLM. Haystack has all it covered:

```python
from haystack.components.builders.prompt_builder import PromptBuilder
from haystack.components.generators import HuggingFaceTGIGenerator

prompt_builder = PromptBuilder("""
Given the following information, answer the question.

Context: 
{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}

Question: {{ query }}
""")
llm = HuggingFaceTGIGenerator(
    model="mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",
    url=os.environ["INFERENCE_ENDPOINT_URL"],
    generation_kwargs={
        "max_new_tokens": 1000,  # Allow longer responses
    },
)

search_pipeline.add_component("prompt_builder", prompt_builder)
search_pipeline.add_component("llm", llm)

search_pipeline.connect("retriever.documents", "prompt_builder.documents")
search_pipeline.connect("prompt_builder.prompt", "llm.prompt")
```

The `PromptBuilder` is a Jinja2 template that will be filled with the documents and the query. The 
`HuggingFaceTGIGenerator` connects to the LLM service and generates the answer. Let's run the pipeline again:

```python
query = "How to install an application using the OpenShift web console?"

response = search_pipeline.run(data={
    "query_embedder": {
        "text": query
    },
    "prompt_builder": {
        "query": query
    },
})
```

The LLM may provide multiple replies, if asked to do so, so let's iterate over and print them out:

```python
for reply in response["llm"]["replies"]:
    print(reply.strip())
```

In our case there is a single response, which should be the answer to the question:

```text
Answer: To install an application using the OpenShift web console, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enter the application’s name.
2. Access the Deploy Image web page.
3. Declare the URL for a container image hosted on a public container image repository.
4. Click the Create button.
5. OpenShift downloads the container image and creates a Linux container using that container image.
6. View the application by using a URL that OpenShift creates.
```

Our final search pipeline might also be visualized, so we can see how the components are glued together:

```python
search_pipeline.draw("search_pipeline.png")
```

![Structure of the search pipeline](/documentation/tutorials/student-rag-haystack-red-hat-openshift-hc/search_pipeline.png)

## Deployment

The pipelines are now ready, and we can export them to YAML. Hayhooks will use these files to run the
pipelines as HTTP endpoints. To do this, specify both file paths and your environment variables. 

> Note: The indexing pipeline might be run inside your ETL tool, but search should be definitely exposed as an HTTP endpoint. 

Let's run it on the local machine:

```shell
pip install hayhooks
```

First of all, we need to save the pipelines to the YAML file:

```python
with open("search-pipeline.yaml", "w") as fp:
    search_pipeline.dump(fp)
```

And now we are able to run the Hayhooks service:

```shell
hayhooks run
```

The command should start the service on the default port, so you can access it at `http://localhost:1416`. The pipeline
is not deployed yet, but we can do it with just another command:

```shell
hayhooks deploy search-pipeline.yaml
```

Once it's finished, you should be able to see the OpenAPI documentation at 
[http://localhost:1416/docs](http://localhost:1416/docs), and test the newly created endpoint.

![Search pipeline in the OpenAPI documentation](/documentation/tutorials/student-rag-haystack-red-hat-openshift-hc/hayhooks-openapi.png)

Our search is now accessible through the HTTP endpoint, so we can integrate it with any other service. We can even 
control the other parameters, like the number of documents to return:

```shell
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:1416/search-pipeline' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "llm": {
  },
  "prompt_builder": {
    "query": "How can I remove an application?"
  },
  "query_embedder": {
    "text": "How can I remove an application?"
  },
  "retriever": {
    "top_k": 5
  }
}'
```

The response should be similar to the one we got in the Python before:

```json
{
  "llm": {
    "replies": [
      "\n\nAnswer: You can remove an application running in OpenShift by right-clicking on the circular graphic representing the application in Topology view and selecting the Delete Application text from the dialog that appears when you click the graphic’s outer ring. Alternatively, you can use the oc CLI tool to delete an installed application using the oc delete all command."
    ],
    "meta": [
      {
        "model": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",
        "index": 0,
        "finish_reason": "eos_token",
        "usage": {
          "completion_tokens": 75,
          "prompt_tokens": 642,
          "total_tokens": 717
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Next steps

Haystack's documentation describes [how to deploy the Hayhooks service in a Kubernetes 
environment](https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/kubernetes), so you can easily move it to your own infrastructure
based on Red Hat OpenShift and enjoy all the components running in a secure and private environment.
