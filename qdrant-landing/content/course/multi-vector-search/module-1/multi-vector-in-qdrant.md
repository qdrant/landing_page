# Multi-Vector Embeddings in Qdrant

Qdrant provides first-class support for multi-vector embeddings through its multi-vector configuration. This lesson covers creating collections, indexing documents, and querying with MaxSim distance.

By the end, you'll have a working multi-modal search system powered by ColPali and Qdrant.
