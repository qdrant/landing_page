We’ve released a new engine, version 0.6.0.

The main feature of the release in the gRPC interface — it is much faster than the REST API and ensures higher app performance due to the following features:

   - re-use of connection;
   - binarity protocol;
   - separation schema from data.

This results in 3 times faster data uploading on our benchmarks:

The release v0.6.0 includes several bug fixes. More information is available in a [changelog](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/releases/tag/v0.6.0).

New version was provided in addition to the REST API that the company keeps supporting due to its easy debugging.
