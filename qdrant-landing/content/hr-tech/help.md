title: "<span class='text-accent'>The problem:</span> recruitment data is fuzzy, but hiring constraints are strict"
paragraphs:
  - "Recruitment search and matching must handle ambiguity (skills synonyms, inconsistent job titles, incomplete resumes), and enforce hard constraints (location, work authorisation, certifications, salary bands, categories)."
  - "\"Semantic match\" alone is insufficient if the candidate or job fails mandatory filters, and keyword-only search misses great matches when terminology doesn't line up. Additionally, job application numbers are increasing due to AI."
