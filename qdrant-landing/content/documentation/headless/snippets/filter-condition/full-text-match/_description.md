This code snippet sets up a field condition to search for a specific substring or phrase within a text field. In this case, a special `text` match is defined with the target text being "good cheap". The behavior may vary depending on the configuration of the full-text index for the field. If there is no full-text index configured for the field, the condition will work as an exact substring match.
