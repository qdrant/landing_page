and providing valuable insights about your models. FiftyOne 0.20, which includes a native integration with Qdrant, supporting workflows 
like [image similarity search](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#image-similarity) and 
[text search](https://docs.voxel51.com/user_guide/brain.html#text-similarity). 

Qdrant helps FiftyOne to find the most similar images in the dataset using vector embeddings.
