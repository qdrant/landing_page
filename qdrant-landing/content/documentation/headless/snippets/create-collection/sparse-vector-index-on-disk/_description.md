Category: Create Collection - Sparse Vector Index on Disk

This code snippet demonstrates creating a collection in Qdrant with a configuration for indexing sparse vectors. When a sparse vector index is used with the "on_disk" option set to false, it indicates that the index will be stored in memory rather than on disk. Sparse vector indexing in Qdrant is exact and does not involve approximation algorithms. The indexing method employed is similar to inverted indexes commonly found in text search engines. By specifying the configuration for sparse vectors in a collection, you can take advantage of efficient indexing optimized for vectors with a high number of zero values. This can lead to more compact and streamlined index structures, especially when managing collections that store both dense and sparse vectors.
