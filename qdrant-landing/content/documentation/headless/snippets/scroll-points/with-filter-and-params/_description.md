Retrieve a single point based on a specified filter condition from a collection of points without being aware of the specific identifiers. It allows for fetching points based on a defined filter criterion. The request includes criteria for filtering points by properties like color, where only points with a color value of "red" will be returned. The response will contain one point with additional payload information, and the vector information will not be included. This functionality enables efficient iteration through points that match the specified filter.
