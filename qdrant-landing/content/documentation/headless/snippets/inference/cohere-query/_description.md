This code snippet illustrates how to use the Cohere API for query-time inference on Qdrant Cloud. Instead of supplying an explicit query vector, the query provides text, along with the name of an Cohere model. When the model name is prepended with `cohere/`, the Qdrant Cloud Inference proxy uses the Cohere API to infer embeddings out of the provided text. Qdrant will search with the resulting vector. The request also shows how to pass Cohere-specific parameters to the API. In this case, the request provides the Cohere API key and the `dimensions` parameter.
