We're excited to introduce **Qdrant Stars**, our new ambassador program created to recognize and support Qdrant users making a strong impact in the AI and vector search space. 

Whether through innovative content, real-world applications tutorials, educational events, or engaging discussions, they are constantly making vector search more accessible and interesting to explore.

### ðŸ‘‹ Say hello to the first Qdrant Stars! 

Our inaugural Qdrant Stars are a diverse and talented lineup who have shown exceptional dedication to our community. You might recognize some of their names:

      <p>Robert is working with a team on <a href="https://asknews.app">AskNews</a> to adaptively enrich, index, and report on over 1 million news articles per day. His team maintains an open-source tool geared toward cluster orchestration <a href="https://flowdapt.ai">Flowdapt</a>, which moves data around highly parallelized production environments. This is why Robert and his team rely on Qdrant for low-latency, scalable, hybrid search across dense and sparse vectors in asynchronous environments.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <blockquote>
  I am interested in brainstorming innovative ways to interact with Qdrant vector databases and building presentations that show the power of coupling Flowdapt with Qdrant for large-scale production GenAI applications. I look forward to networking with Qdrant experts and users so that I can learn from their experience.
