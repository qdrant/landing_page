This code snippet demonstrates a configuration to enable high precision and high-speed search by storing data in RAM and applying scalar quantization with an integer type of 8 bits for a specific collection. The vectors in the collection have a size of 768 and utilize cosine distance for comparison. The quantization setting ensures that the data is always stored in RAM for fast retrieval and efficient processing.
