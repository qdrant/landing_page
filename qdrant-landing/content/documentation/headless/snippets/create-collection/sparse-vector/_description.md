This code snippet demonstrates creating a collection in Qdrant with support for sparse vectors. Sparse vectors are useful for text search, representing each word as a separate dimension. This feature allows collections to contain both sparse vectors and regular dense vectors in one point. Sparse vectors need to be named uniquely within a collection, separate from the names of dense vectors.
