This code snippet applies exponential decay to boost the relevance of search results based on a datetime field called "upload_time" in the payload (which can be when a point was uploaded to Qdrant). Items closer in time to a specified `target`, so, in our case, the current datetime, which means "fresher" results, receive higher scores. Relevance score is decreasing exponentially with "upload_time" getting further away from `target` time, reaching a 0.5 `midpoint` of relevance after a defined `scale` period of 1 day.
