This code configures a new collection with binary quantization with asymmetric quantization.
Asymmetric quantization may have different bit depth, in this example we use 1 bit for stored vectors and 8 bits for query encoding.
Using asymmetric quantization allows to improve precision of the search results at a slight cost of performance.
