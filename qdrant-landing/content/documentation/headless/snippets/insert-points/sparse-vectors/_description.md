This code snippet showcases a system for inserting points with sparse vectors into collections. Each point consists of an ID and a vector, where the vector data includes the indices and corresponding values. The `indices` and `values` arrays are required to have the same length, with unique `indices`. If the `indices` are not sorted, the system will internally sort them. Sparse vectors can be uploaded in a similar manner as dense vectors.
