description: "We asked our users building vector search why they moved to Qdrant from Elastic, Opensearch or another Lucene-based search engine. Here’s what they tell us:"

  - Unacceptably slow queries with vector search
  - Endless indexing jobs
  - Overspending on over-provisioned memory
  - Brittle hybrid search
