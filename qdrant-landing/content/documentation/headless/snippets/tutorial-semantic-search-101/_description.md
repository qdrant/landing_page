This code snippet shows how to create a semantic search engine with Qdrant. First, a client connection to Qdrant Cloud is established using the cluster URL and API key, and cloud inference is enabled for automatic embedding generation. Next, a collection named `my_books` is created with a vector size of 384 and cosine distance. A dataset of science fiction books is defined, and each book is stored as a point in the collection with a unique ID, a vector generated from the description, and a payload containing the book's metadata. Finally, a query is made to the search engine to find books related to an alien invasion, and the most relevant results are returned with their similarity scores. The code also demonstrates how to apply a filter to query in order to return only books published after the year 2000.
