# Qdrant Essentials Course

**From first vector to production‑grade retrieval in 8 days.**

Build the vector search skills that matter: hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, quantization, distributed deployment, and multitenancy. Ship a complete documentation search engine as your final project.

## What you'll learn
{{< course-card
 title="Skills you'll gain:"
 image="/icons/outline/training-white.svg"
 type="wide-list">}}

- Vector data modeling: points, payloads, and schemas
- Embeddings, chunking, and similarity metrics
- Indexing and retrieval tuning (HNSW, filters, recall/latency)
- Hybrid search with sparse + dense vectors and re-ranking
- Performance optimization, compression, and quantization
- Scaling, sharding/replication, and security

{{< /course-card >}}

### The Path

Days 0–2: Foundations. Connect to Qdrant Cloud, understand points and payloads, measure similarity, chunk text, and tune HNSW indexes for speed and recall.

Days 3–5: Advanced retrieval. Combine dense and sparse signals, implement hybrid search with server‑side fusion, master multivectors (ColBERT) and the Universal Query API, and build recommendation systems.

Days 6–7: Production deployment. Scale horizontally with sharding and replication, implement JWT‑based multitenancy, configure quantization for 40× speedups, and secure production clusters.

Day 8: Ship it. Wire an end‑to‑end documentation search engine with ingestion, hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, and evaluation metrics (Recall@10, MRR, latency P50/P95).

Day 9 (bonus): Ecosystem. Explore integrations with AI frameworks, search platforms, and data processing tools.
