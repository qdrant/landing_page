This code snippet demonstrates the configuration to create a collection with scalar quantization parameters. The `quantization_config` section includes specifications for scalar quantization, such as the data type (`int8`), the quantile value (0.99), and whether it should always be in RAM. To enable scalar quantization for an existing collection, you can use a PATCH request or the `update_collection` method, excluding the vector configuration that's already defined.
