This code snippet demonstrates the insertion of points with multiple vectors into a collection. Each point has an id associated with it, along with vectors containing numerical values. The vectors are named 'image' and 'text' and consist of arrays of floating-point numbers. The API request uses the PUT method to upload the point data. Qdrant's idempotent nature ensures that re-uploading points with the same id will overwrite existing data, providing data consistency even in environments like message queues that lack exactly-once delivery guarantees. This feature is available starting from version 0.10.0.
