This code snippet illustrates how to use smaller vectors for the initial prefetching of candidates from a large collection, followed by re-scoring with the original-sized vectors to improve accuracy, combined with inference. For the smaller vector, it employs Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) to reduce the dimensionality of embeddings by specifying the `mrl` parameter in the `options` object.
