This code snippet creates a collection with specific configurations for vectors and optimizers. It sets the vector size to 768 and the distance metric to Cosine. It also configures the optimizers with a default segment number of 2 and a maximum segment size of 5000000. These settings aim to optimize throughput by utilizing fewer segments to handle parallel requests and benefit from large segment sizes for optimized index performance.
