# MUVERA

MUVERA (Multi-Vector Retrieval with Approximation) solves a fundamental problem: MaxSim's asymmetry makes traditional indexing methods like HNSW ineffective. MUVERA enables fast approximate search for multi-vector representations.

Understanding MUVERA is key to scaling multi-vector search to millions of documents.

Next, we'll learn to combine all these optimizations in multi-stage retrieval pipelines using Qdrant's Universal Query API.
