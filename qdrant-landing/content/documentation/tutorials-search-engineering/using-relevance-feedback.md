In Qdrant 1.17 we introduced a new [Relevance Feedback Query](/documentation/concepts/search-relevance/#relevance-feedback), our scalable, first ever vector index-native approach to [incorporating relevance feedback](/articles/search-feedback-loop/) in retrieval.

In this tutorial, you'll see how to: 
1. Customize Relevance Feedback Query for your Qdrant collection, retriever and feedback model.
2. Add customized Relevance Feedback Query to your search pipeline.
3. Evaluate the gains it brings to this pipeline.

## Relevance Feedback

> Relevance feedback distills signals about the relevance of current search results into the next retrieval iteration, surfacing better results over time.

The Relevance Feedback Query uses a small amount of model-generated feedback on the search results to guide the retriever through the entire vector space on the next retrieval iteration, nudging search toward more relevant results.  
A detailed description of how it works can be found in the article [Relevance Feedback in Qdrant](/articles/relevance-feedback/).

![Overview of Relevance Feedback](/blog/qdrant-1.17.x/relevance-feedback-overview.png)

### Strategy

To use the feedback for guiding a retriever in the vector space, there are several possible strategies. For now, only the **naive strategy** is available -- [a simple 3-parameter formula](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search-relevance/#naive-strategy) which adjusts similarity scoring based on the feedback.

For the strategy to work well, the parameters of this naive formula should be customized for your data, retriever and feedback model.
For convenience, we provide you with a [`qdrant-relevance-feedback` Python package](https://pypi.org/project/qdrant-relevance-feedback/) that gives you the corresponding parameters for your use case.

This tutorial will demonstrate how to use it together with the Relevance Feedback Query API.

## Customizing for Your Use Case

### Setup

Install the aforementioned package (it will automatically install the Qdrant Client as its dependency):

```bash
pip install qdrant-relevance-feedback
```

We're going to use a [Qdrant Cloud Free Tier Cluster](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/create-cluster/#free-clusters) (make sure it's on version 1.17.0+) and [Free Embedding Inference](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/cloud/inference/#free-embedding-models) available on this Free Tier Cluster.

[Create a Qdrant Free Tier Cluster](https://cloud.qdrant.io/) and initialize the Qdrant Client:

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(
    url=<QDRANT_URL>,
    api_key=<QDRANT_API_KEY>,
    cloud_inference=True # to be able to use free embedding inference on Qdrant Cloud, for convenience & to reduce latency
)
```

#### Dataset

We'll use one of the datasets available in the Qdrant Cluster UI.

1. Go to Cluster UI -> Datasets. 
2. Out of 3 datasets there, pick the first one, "Qdrant Web Documentation". It consists of small text chunks from [our documentation website](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/).
3. Press the `Import` button and type in a collection name -- `documentation`. 

![Qdrant Cluster UI Datasets](/documentation/tutorials/using-relevance-feedback/dataset.png)

After a couple of seconds you should see a green status pop up *"Snapshot successfully imported"* and a collection named `documentation` in the list of all collections.

Now we have a collection to work with and optimize semantic search in.

```python
COLLECTION_NAME = "documentation"
```

#### Retriever

The **retriever** is an embedding model that converts your raw data into vectors for semantic similarity search. The Relevance Feedback Query will help you optimize your retriever's ability to find relevant results in your data.

Our retriever is already defined by our collection -- as the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` tag on the dataset's "VECTORS CONFIG" shows us, vectors in the collection are produced with the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model.

Let's define it in our `qdrant-relevance-feedback` framework.

```python
from qdrant_relevance_feedback.retriever import QdrantRetriever

retriever = QdrantRetriever("sentence-transformers/all-minilm-l6-v2")
```

> QdrantRetriever supports all Qdrant Cloud Inference and FastEmbed models, and `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is covered by Qdrant Free Tier Cloud Inference. You can define and provide your custom retrievers, too.

Check what a point in this collection looks like.

![Point in the documentation collection](/documentation/tutorials/using-relevance-feedback/point.png)

Our documentation collection has only one vector per point -- `Default vector`. However, in Qdrant, one can have several [named vectors](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/vectors/#named-vectors) per point.

We need to provide the name of the vector associated with the retriever that we're planning to optimize with feedback.

```python
RETRIEVER_VECTOR_NAME = None # None if it's a default vector or your named vector handle in Qdrant's collection
```

We also need to point our framework to the raw data which is vectorized with our retriever model. Here, the raw data is the `text` field in the point's [payload](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/payload/#payload). Simply put, we search on `text` snippets -- in their vectorized form.

```python
PAYLOAD_KEY = "text"
```

*If your raw data is stored elsewhere outside of Qdrant, you can redefine the `payload_retrieval` part in `qdrant-relevance-feedback`.*

#### Feedback Model

The **feedback model** looks at the results your retriever provides and scores how relevant they are. The retriever then uses this feedback, via the Relevance Feedback Query interface, to orient itself better in the vector space and surface more relevant documents.

As a provider of a feedback model in this tutorial, we'll use Qdrant's lightweight inference library called [FastEmbed](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/fastembed/).

```bash
pip install fastembed
```

As `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` is a small (only 384 dimensions) and weak model, we don't have to pick a feedback model which is too strong or expensive. Such a small retriever won't be receptive to sophisticated feedback anyway.

Hence, for simplicity, we can use a bi-encoder of a bigger dimensionality, for example, `mxbai-embed-large-v1` of 1024 dimensions.

```python
from qdrant_relevance_feedback.feedback import FastembedFeedback

feedback = FastembedFeedback("mixedbread-ai/mxbai-embed-large-v1")
```
*This code will download `mxbai-embed-large-v1` for local inference.*

> We provide FastembedFeedback with all the FastEmbed models. However, you can define and provide your custom feedback model, too. It can be anything: bi-encoder, late interaction model, cross-encoder or LLM.

#### Plugging in Collection, Retriever and Feedback Model

Now we have everything in place: retriever, collection, feedback model.

```python
from qdrant_relevance_feedback import RelevanceFeedback

relevance_feedback = RelevanceFeedback(
        retriever=retriever,
        feedback=feedback,
        client=client,
        collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
        vector_name=RETRIEVER_VECTOR_NAME,
        payload_key=PAYLOAD_KEY
)
```

We can run a small training process, which will collect data and adjust the Relevance Feedback Query parameters (`naive strategy`) for this triplet.

### Training 

#### Training Data

How well the relevance feedback formula fits your data depends on the amount and **quality** of the training data (how realistic it is for your use case).  
In general, we need **a very little amount** of it (50-300 queries will suffice), as we only need to train 3 parameters.

We've generated 50 queries with Claude Code, using the prompt *"Generate 50 short search queries (3-10 words each) that a developer might type when browsing Qdrant's website."*.

]
```

</details>

Another parameter controlling training data size is how many responses we retrieve from our collection per each query.

```python
TRAIN_LIMIT = 25
```

The bigger the `TRAIN_LIMIT`, the more training data our formula gets, but the more expensive and slow the training becomes.

*For training, we need our feedback model to provide ground truth relevancy scores, so it rescores #queries * TRAIN_LIMIT, here 50 * 25 = 1250 query-document pairs. Adjust based on your training budget.*

#### Training Process

Now we can run the training:

```python
formula_params = relevance_feedback.train(
    queries=train_queries,
    limit=TRAIN_LIMIT,
)
```

You'll see a "**Building training data**" process running on 50 queries.
Additionally, the framework will provide you with a sensibility check, something like:

```bash
On 22.00% of training queries the feedback model strongly disagreed with the retriever model.
```

> If the feedback model agrees with your retriever in all cases (if percentage is 0.00), there's little point in using the chosen setup for relevance feedback-based retrieval, consider changing the setup.

Then after a blazingly fast training, you'll get your parameters, something like:

```bash
Naive formula params: a=0.240764, b=1.348897, c=0.590883
```

These are the parameters customized to our `documentation` collection, `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` retriever and `mxbai-embed-large-v1` feedback model.

Now we can use them for relevance feedback-based retrieval with any client of your choice.

## Adding Relevance Feedback Query to a Search Pipeline

Let's see how introducing the Relevance Feedback Query to a retrieval pipeline could work on this use case.

**Reason:** Let's say you're powering documentation search with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, as it's very cheap and fast, but often it doesn't provide relevant enough results and you know there are more relevant parts of documentation than what `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` gets you.

For example, let's look at this query:

```python
query = "recommendations API how to use"
```

### 1. Vanilla Initial Retrieval

We run simple semantic similarity search with our retriever, as we'd normally do in our search application.

```python
query_embedding = retriever.embed_query(query)
CONTEXT_LIMIT = 3

responses = client.query_points(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    query=query_embedding,
    with_payload=True,
    with_vectors=True,
    limit=CONTEXT_LIMIT,
    using=RETRIEVER_VECTOR_NAME,
).points
```

Let's see what results we get:

```python
responses_raw = [r.payload[PAYLOAD_KEY] for r in responses]

print("\n--- Initial Retrieval Results ---")
for i, text in enumerate(responses_raw, 1):
    print(f"  [{i}] {text[:200]}")
print()
```

We'll get something like:

```bash
--- Initial Retrieval Results ---
  [1] Recommendation API
  [2] recommendation API.
  [3] So, even when the API is not called recommend, recommendation systems can also use this approach and adapt it for their specific use-cases.
```

*We're seeing duplicates as our collection consists of chunks from our documentation website and some text is identical across different sections.*

Works, but perhaps there's something else in our collection that would answer the query better -- the retriever is just too weak to pick it up.

### 2. Getting Feedback on Initial Retrieval

Now we get feedback from our `mxbai-embed-large-v1` feedback model on the top 3 results for the query *"recommendations API how to use"*.

The feedback model rescores them according to its own judgement of semantic similarity. We only show it a small number of results (`CONTEXT_LIMIT` = 3) to keep the pipeline fast and cheap.

```python
feedback_model_scores = feedback.score(query, responses_raw)
```

### 3. Relevance Feedback-based Retrieval

Now we can strengthen our `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` retriever with the given feedback on 3 initial retrieved responses.

We provide the feedback as a list of (example, score) pairs. Under the hood, this uses the mechanism of context pairs mining described in the [article](https://qdrant.tech/articles/search-feedback-loop/).

```python
from qdrant_client import models

responses_point_ids = [p.id for p in responses] # CONTEXT_LIMIT responses from initial vanilla retrieval (their point IDs)
#responses_vectors = [p.vector for p in responses]

relevance_feedback_responses = client.query_points(
    collection_name=COLLECTION_NAME,
    query=models.RelevanceFeedbackQuery(
        relevance_feedback=models.RelevanceFeedbackInput(
            target=query_embedding,
            feedback=[
                models.FeedbackItem(example=example, score=score)
                for example, score in zip(responses_point_ids, feedback_model_scores) # or zip(responses_vectors, feedback_model_scores)
            ],
            strategy=models.NaiveFeedbackStrategy(
                naive=models.NaiveFeedbackStrategyParams(**formula_params) # our parameters from above
            ),
        )
    ),
    with_payload=True,
    limit=3,
    using=RETRIEVER_VECTOR_NAME,
).points
```

Let's see what relevance feedback-based retrieval brings to the table:

```python
relevance_feedback_responses_raw = [r.payload[PAYLOAD_KEY] for r in relevance_feedback_responses]

print("\n--- Additional Results from Relevance Feedback-based Retrieval ---")
for i, text in enumerate(relevance_feedback_responses_raw, 1):
    print(f"  [{i}] {text[:200]}")
print()
```

It should return something like this:

```bash
--- Additional Results from Relevance Feedback-based Retrieval ---
  [1] Recap of the old recommendations API
  [2] The result of this API contains one array per recommendation requests.
  [3] Deliver Better Recommendations with Qdrant's new API
```

### 4. Combining all the Steps

Now you can use Relevance Feedback Query results in different ways:

- **Combine with initial retrieval**, for example, rerank the union of both result sets with the feedback model.
- **Use as your main results**, aka rely on the Relevance Feedback Query as the primary source of search results.

*Approach is tied to what you're passing to the `example` field in `FeedbackItem` (or analogues in other clients): raw retriever-produced embeddings or point IDs from your collection.*

> If you're passing point IDs as `example`s, these points are automatically excluded from the results. To include them among other points, pass the raw vectors (see commented `responses_vectors`) instead of point IDs.

## Evaluation

Empirically, Relevance Feedback Query results on the query above looked relevant. Yet we can imagine that might not be enough to justify adding additional complexity to your pipeline.  
The framework we released also provides an evaluation block.

Analogously, we've generated a test set of queries.

<details>
<summary>Test queries</summary>

```python
test_queries = [
    "how to install qdrant locally",
    "qdrant vector similarity search",
    "qdrant HNSW filtering vs pre-filtering performance",
    "qdrant payload filtering and indexing",

    "getting started vector search beginner",
]
```

</details>

Now let's run our evaluation on this test set, and see how much gain we get, considering that our feedback model receives `CONTEXT_LIMIT` results per query to provide feedback on.

```python
from qdrant_relevance_feedback.evaluate import Evaluator

N = 10  # as in metric@N

evaluator = Evaluator(relevance_feedback=relevance_feedback)

results = evaluator.evaluate_queries(
    at_n=N,
    formula_params=formula_params, # from above
    eval_queries=test_queries,
    eval_context_limit=CONTEXT_LIMIT # from above
)
```

We'll get output looking like this, providing us with *relative results relevance gain* and *discounted cumulative gain (DCG) win rates* at *N* (here, 10).

```bash
On the 2nd retrieval iteration, over this test set:
  Relevance feedback retrieval surfaced 44 more relevant results (according to the feedback model)
  Vanilla retrieval surfaced 39 more relevant results (according to the feedback model)

Relative results relevance gain over this test set is: 12.82051282051282%

DCG win rates (which approach ranks results better):
  Vanilla retrieval:            38.0% wins
  Relevance feedback retrieval:  48.0% wins
  Ties:                          14.0%
```

**Relative results relevance gain**: over this test set of 50 generated queries, relevance feedback-based retrieval pulled 5 (44 - 39) more relevant documents from the collection, which the retriever was unable to "notice" -- a 13% boost over vanilla retrieval.

**DCG win rate**: on ~half of the queries (48%), relevance feedback-based retrieval ranks results within the evaluation window N better than the retriever would. In 14% of queries, both methods are identical, and in 38% relevance feedback confuses the retriever.

*A detailed explanation of the metrics is in the [article](https://qdrant.tech/articles/search-feedback-loop/), including accompanying visualizations.*

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to use relevance feedback on text data to increase the relevance of results in your retrieval pipelines. Here's what to keep in mind:

- **Adaptable to your data** -- works on different modalities, not only text. You can do the same with images, for example.
- **Flexible model choice** -- you can use predefined retrievers and feedback models we support in Cloud Inference and FastEmbed, or define your own, anything, including LLMs and custom LTR models.
- **Built-in evaluation** -- with our framework, you can also evaluate the potential gains of using the Relevance Feedback Query before putting it into production.
