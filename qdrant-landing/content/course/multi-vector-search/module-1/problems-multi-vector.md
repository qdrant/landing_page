# Problems of Multi-Vector Search

Multi-vector search delivers impressive retrieval quality, but it comes with significant challenges. Before deploying multi-vector search in production, you need to understand these limitations and plan accordingly.

The good news: Module 3 covers optimization techniques that address many of these challenges.

Understanding these challenges is crucial. In Module 2, we'll extend multi-vector search to multi-modal data, and in Module 3, we'll tackle these scalability issues head-on with optimization techniques.
