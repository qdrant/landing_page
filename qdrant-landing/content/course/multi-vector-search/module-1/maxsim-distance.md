# MaxSim Distance Metric

MaxSim (Maximum Similarity) is the core distance metric for late interaction models. Unlike traditional vector similarity metrics that operate on pairs of single vectors, MaxSim computes similarity between sets of vectors.

Understanding MaxSim is crucial for working with multi-vector search effectively and understanding its performance characteristics.
