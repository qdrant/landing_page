This code snippet demonstrates how to configure a full-text index for case-sensitive match support for a specified field in a collection. The index configuration includes details such as the field name, type (text), tokenizer (word), and whether to convert tokens to lowercase. Lowercasing is enabled by default, enabling case-sensitive matching. This setup disables lowercasing, enabling the filtering og points based on the presence of exact words in the field.
