# Setup and First Steps

Get started with Qdrant by setting up your environment and building your first vector search application.

## Today’s path

1. Qdrant Cloud setup
2. Your first vector search (guided)
3. Day 0 Task (pitstop project)

By the end, you’ll have a working Qdrant setup and a complete first search running.
