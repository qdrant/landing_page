title: Distributed deployment
weight: 50
---

Since version v0.8.0 Qdrant supports a distributed deployment mode.
In this mode, multiple Qdrant services communicate with each other to distribute the data across the peers to extend the storage capabilities and increase stability.

To enable distributed deployment - enable the cluster mode in the [configuration](../configuration) or using the ENV variable: `QDRANT__CLUSTER__ENABLED=true`.

```yaml
cluster:
  # Use `enabled: true` to run Qdrant in distributed deployment mode
  enabled: true
  # Configuration of the inter-cluster communication
  p2p:
    # Port for internal communication between peers
    port: 6335

  # Configuration related to distributed consensus algorithm
  consensus:
    # How frequently peers should ping each other.
    # Setting this parameter to lower value will allow consensus
    # to detect disconnected node earlier, but too frequent
    # tick period may create significant network and CPU overhead.
    # We encourage you NOT to change this parameter unless you know what you are doing.
    tick_period_ms: 100
```

With default configuration, Qdrant will use port `6335` for its internal communication.
All peers should be accessible on this port from within the cluster, but make sure to isolate this port from outside access, as it might be used to perform write operations.

Additionally, the first peer of the cluster should be provided with its URL, so it could tell other nodes how it should be reached.
Use the `uri` CLI argument to provide the URL to the peer:

```bash
./qdrant --uri 'http://qdrant_node_1:6335'
```

Subsequent peers in a cluster must know at least one node of the existing cluster to synchronize through it with the rest of the cluster.

To do this, they need to be provided with a bootstrap URL:

```bash
./qdrant --bootstrap 'http://qdrant_node_1:6335'
```

The URL of the new peers themselves will be calculated automatically from the IP address of their request.
But it is also possible to provide them individually using `--uri` argument.

```text
USAGE:
    qdrant [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
        --bootstrap <URI>
            Uri of the peer to bootstrap from in case of multi-peer deployment. If not specified -
            this peer will be considered as a first in a new deployment

        --uri <URI>
            Uri of this peer. Other peers should be able to reach it by this uri.
            
            This value has to be supplied if this is the first peer in a new deployment.
            
            In case this is not the first peer and it bootstraps the value is optional. If not
            supplied then qdrant will take internal grpc port from config and derive the IP address
            of this peer on bootstrap peer (receiving side)

```

After a successful synchronization you can observe the state of the cluster through the [REST API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html?v=master#tag/cluster):

```http
GET /cluster
```

Example result:

```json

    "status": "enabled",
    "peer_id": 11532566549086892000,
    "peers": {

      },
      "11532566549086892528": {

    }
  },

}
```

## Raft

Qdrant is using the [Raft](https://raft.github.io/) consensus protocol to maintain consistency regarding the cluster topology and the collections structure.

Operation with points, on the other hand, are not going through the consensus infrastructure.
Qdrant is not intended to have strong transaction guarantees, which allows it to perform point operations with low overhead.
In practice, it means that Qdrant does not guarantee atomic distributed updates but allows you to wait until the [operation is complete](../points/#awaiting-result) to see the results of your writes.

Collection operations, on the contrary, are part of the consensus which guarantees that all operations are durable and eventually executed by all nodes.
In practice it means that a majority of node agree on what operations should be applied before the service will perform them.

Practically, it means that if the cluster is in a transition state - either electing a new leader after a failure or starting up, the collection update operations will be denied.

You may use the cluster [REST API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html?v=master#tag/cluster) to check the state of the consensus.

## Sharding

A Collection in Qdrant is made of one or several shards.
Each shard is an independent storage of points which is able to perform all operations provided by collections.
Points are distributed among shards according to the [consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) algorithm, so that shards are managing non-intersecting subsets of points.

During the creation of the collection, shards are evenly distributed across all existing nodes.
Each node knows where all parts of the collection are stored through the [consensus protocol](./#raft), so if it is time to search - each node could query all other nodes to obtain the full search result.

You can define number of shards in your create-collection request:

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{
    "name": "example_collection",
    "vectors": {
      "size": 300,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "shard_number": 6
}
```

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models

client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

client.recreate_collection(
    name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=300, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    shard_number=6
)
```

We recommend selecting the number of shards as a factor of the number of nodes you are currently running in your cluster.
For example, if you have 3 nodes, 6 shards could be a good option.

### Cluster scaling

If you want to extend your cluster with new nodes or some nodes become slower than the others, it might be helpful to re-balance the shard distribution in the cluster.

*Since version v0.9.0*, Qdrant allows moving shards between nodes in the cluster and removing nodes from the cluster.

This functionality unlocks the ability to dynamically scale the cluster size without downtime.

Qdrant provides the information regarding the current shard distribution in the cluster with the [Collection Cluster info API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/collection_cluster_info).

Use the [Update collection cluster setup API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/update_collection_cluster) to initiate the shard transfer:

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/cluster

{
  "move_shard": {
    "shard_id": 0,
    "from_peer_id": 381894127,
    "to_peer_id": 467122995
  }
}
```

After the transfer is initiated, the service will keep both copies of the shard updated until the transfer is complete.
It will also make sure the transferred shard indexing process is keeping up before performing a final switch. This way, Qdrant ensures that there will be no degradation in performance at the end of the transfer.

In case you want to downscale the cluster, you can move all shards away from a peer and then remove the peer using [Remove peer from the cluster API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/remove_peer).

```http
DELETE /cluster/peer/{peer_id}
```

After that, Qdrant will exclude the node from the consensus, and the instance will be ready for the shutdown.

## Replication

*Since version v0.11.0*, Qdrant allows to replicate shards between nodes in the cluster.

Shard replication increases the reliability of the cluster by keeping several copies of a shard spread among the cluster.
This ensure the availability of the shards in case of node failures, except if all replicas are lost.

By default, all the shards in a cluster have a replication factor of one, meaning no additional copy is maintained.

The replication factor of a collection can be configured at creation time.

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{
    "name": "example_collection",
    "vectors": {
      "size": 300,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "shard_number": 6,
    "replication_factor": 2,
}
```

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models

client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

client.recreate_collection(
    name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=300, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    shard_number=6,
    replication_factor=2,
)
```

This code sample creates a collection with a total of 6 logical shards backed by a total of 12 physical shards.

It is advised to make sure the hardware can host the additional shards beforehand.

### Scaling replication factor

It is possible to create or delete replicas manually on an existing collection using the [Update collection cluster setup API](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html?v=v0.11.0#tag/cluster/operation/update_collection_cluster).

A replica can be added on a specific peer by specifying the peer from which to replicate.

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/cluster

{
  "replicate_shard": {
    "shard_id": 0,
    "from_peer_id": 381894127,
    "to_peer_id": 467122995
  }
}
```

And a replica can be removed on a specific peer.

```http
POST /collections/{collection_name}/cluster

{
  "drop_replica": {
    "shard_id": 0,
    "peer_id": 381894127
  }
}
```

Keep in mind that a collection must contain at least one active replica of a shard.

### Error handling

Replicas can be in different state:

- Active: healthy and ready to serve traffic
- Dead: unhealthy and not ready to serve traffic
- Partial: currently under resynchronization before activation

A replica is marked as dead if it does not respond to internal healthchecks or if it fails to serve traffic.

A dead replica will not receive traffic from other peers and might require a manual intervention if it does not recover automatically.

This mechanism ensures data consistency and availability if a subset of the replicas fail during an update operation.

### Node Failure Recovery

Sometimes hardware malfunctions might render some nodes of the qdrant cluster unrecoverable.
No system is immune to this.

But several recovery scenarios allow qdrant to stay available for requests and even avoid performance degradation.
Let's walk throw them from best to worst.

**Recover with replicated collection**

If the number of failed nodes is less than the replication factor of the collection, you are service, then no data is lost. 
Your cluster should still be able to perform read, search and update queries.

Now, if the failed node restarts, consensus will trigger the replication process to update the recovering node with the newest updates it has missed.

**Recreate node with replicated collections**

If it is impossible to recover, you should exclude the dead node from the consensus and create an empty node.

To exclude failed nodes from the consensus, use [remove peer](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/remove_peer) API.
Apply the `force` flag if necessary.

When you create a new node, make sure to attach it to the existing cluster by specifying `--bootstrap` CLI parameter with the URL of any of the running cluster nodes. 

Once the new node is ready and synchronized with the cluster, you might want to ensure that the collection shards are replicated enough. 
Use [Replicate Shard Operation](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/update_collection_cluster) to create another copy of the shard on the newly connected node.

Worth mentioning that Qdrant only provides the necessary building blocks to create an automated failure recovery.
Building a completely automatic process of collection scaling would require control over the cluster machines themself.
Check out our [cloud solution](https://qdrant.tech/surveys/cloud-request/), where we made exactly that.


**Recover from snapshot**


If there are no copies of data in the cluster, it is still possible to recover from a snapshot.

Follow the same steps to detach failed node and create a new one in the cluster:


* To exclude failed nodes from the consensus, use [remove peer](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html#tag/cluster/operation/remove_peer) API. Apply the `force` flag if necessary.
* Create a new node, making sure to attach it to the existing cluster by specifying `--bootstrap` CLI parameter with the URL of any of the running cluster nodes. 

Snapshot recovery, used in single-node deployment, is different from cluster one.
Consensus manages all metadata about all collections and does not require snapshots to recover it.
But you can use snapshots to recover missing shards of the collections.

Use [Collection Snapshot Recovery API](../snapshots/#recover-in-cluster-deployment) to do it.
The service will download specified snapshot of the collection and recover shards with data from it.

Once all shards of the collection are recovered, the collection will become operational again.

### Consistency guarantees

During the normal state of operation, it is possible to search and modify data from any peers in the cluster.

Before responding to the client, the peer handling the request dispatches all operations according to the current topology in order to keep the data synchronized across the cluster.

- reads are using a partial fan-out strategy to optimize latency and availability
- writes are executed in parallel on all active sharded replicas

In case of write operations, it is possible to control when the server replies to the client using the write concern factor configuration.

The `write_concern_factor` represents the number of replicas that must acknowledge a write operation before responding to the client. It is set to one by default.

It can be configured at the collection's creation time.

```http
PUT /collections/{collection_name}

{
    "name": "example_collection",
    "vectors": {
      "size": 300,
      "distance": "Cosine"
    },
    "shard_number": 6,
    "replication_factor": 2,
    "write_concern_factor": 2,
}
```

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient
from qdrant_client.http import models

client = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)

client.recreate_collection(
    name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=300, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    shard_number=6,
    replication_factor=2,
    write_concern_factor=2,
)
```

Setting `write_concern_factor` equal to `replication_factor` ensures that all replicas are updated synchonously, provididing a read after write consistency for sequential operations.

However, it gets more complicated for concurrent operations, especially when they are issued against different peers.

Given that, Qdrant does not provide transactional operations at the level of a collection, it is not possible to enforce that all peers have observed the same operations in the same order.

![Embeddings](/docs/concurrent-operations-replicas.png)

For this reason, it is recommended to perform write operation targeting a specific collection with overlapping keys in a sequential fashion by, for instance, using a distributed queueing mechanism as a proxy.

Search queries can be safely performed concurrently without risks.
