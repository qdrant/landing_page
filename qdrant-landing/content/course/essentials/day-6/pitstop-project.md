# Project: Capacity Planning and Scaling Simulation

Since the free tier runs on a single node, you can't test actual distributed deployment. Instead, you'll build a capacity planning toolkit that simulates scaling decisions and tests optimization strategies. This teaches you to think like an infrastructure engineer making real scaling decisions.

## Your Mission

Create a capacity planning system that analyzes workload requirements and simulates scaling decisions. You'll test memory optimization strategies within free tier constraints and build recommendations for production scaling.

**Estimated Time:** 75 minutes

## What You'll Build

- **Workload analyzer** that calculates memory and infrastructure requirements
- **Optimization tester** that compares different memory strategies
- **Scaling simulator** that models distributed deployment decisions
- **Cost calculator** that analyzes financial impact of scaling choices

## Step 1: Build a Workload Analyzer

Create a tool that calculates infrastructure requirements for different scenarios:

```python
def analyze_workload(vectors_count, vector_dim, payload_size_kb):
    """Calculate memory requirements for a workload"""
    
    # Basic memory calculations
    vector_memory_gb = (vectors_count * vector_dim * 4) / (1024**3)  # float32
    payload_memory_gb = (vectors_count * payload_size_kb * 1024) / (1024**3)
    hnsw_overhead_gb = vector_memory_gb * 0.8  # HNSW index overhead
    
    total_memory_gb = (vector_memory_gb + payload_memory_gb + hnsw_overhead_gb) * 1.3  # 30% headroom
    
    # Calculate optimization potential
    optimizations = {
        "float16": total_memory_gb * 0.5,      # 50% reduction
        "scalar_quantization": total_memory_gb * 0.25,  # 75% reduction
        "binary_quantization": total_memory_gb * 0.03   # 97% reduction
    }
    
    return {
        "base_memory_gb": round(total_memory_gb, 2),
        "optimizations": {k: round(v, 2) for k, v in optimizations.items()},
        "fits_free_tier": total_memory_gb <= 1.0
    }

# Test with different scenarios
scenarios = [
    {"name": "Startup docs", "vectors": 50000, "dim": 384, "payload": 1.5},
    {"name": "E-commerce", "vectors": 500000, "dim": 768, "payload": 3.0},
    {"name": "Enterprise", "vectors": 2000000, "dim": 1024, "payload": 5.0}
]

for scenario in scenarios:
    result = analyze_workload(scenario["vectors"], scenario["dim"], scenario["payload"])
    print(f"{scenario['name']}: {result['base_memory_gb']}GB needed")
    print(f"  Best optimization: {min(result['optimizations'].items(), key=lambda x: x[1])}")
```

**Your task**: Expand this analyzer to include growth projections, node sizing recommendations, and cost estimates. Test it with your own workload scenarios.

## Step 2: Test Memory Optimization Strategies

Compare different optimization approaches within the free tier:

```python
def test_optimization_strategy(config_name, collection_config):
    """Test a specific optimization strategy"""
    
    collection_name = f"test_{config_name}"
    
    # Create collection with optimization
    client.create_collection(
        collection_name=collection_name,
        **collection_config
    )
    
    # Upload test data and measure performance
    test_points = [/* create test vectors */]
    
    start_time = time.time()
    client.upsert(collection_name=collection_name, points=test_points)
    upload_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Measure search performance
    # Test with and without filters
    # Record memory efficiency
    
    return {
        "upload_time": upload_time,
        "search_time_ms": /* measure search time */,
        "max_vectors_estimate": /* estimate capacity */
    }
```

**Your task**: Implement this tester for baseline, float16, and quantization strategies. Compare their memory efficiency and performance trade-offs. Document which strategy works best for different use cases.

## Step 3: Simulate Distributed Deployment Decisions

Build a decision framework for scaling choices:

```python
def simulate_cluster_design(memory_requirements_gb, availability_needs, budget_limit):
    """Simulate cluster design decisions"""
    
    # Define node types and costs
    node_options = {
        "small": {"ram": 8, "cost": 100},
        "medium": {"ram": 32, "cost": 400}, 
        "large": {"ram": 128, "cost": 1600}
    }
    
    # Calculate options for single node vs distributed
    # Consider replication factors and their costs
    # Evaluate availability trade-offs
    
    return cluster_recommendations

def simulate_failure_scenarios(cluster_config):
    """Model what happens during different failure types"""
    
    # Node maintenance impact
    # Hardware failure consequences  
    # Network partition behavior
    
    return failure_analysis
```

**Your task**: Complete the simulator to evaluate different cluster configurations. Test scenarios like "2-node vs 3-node clusters" and "replication factor 2 vs 3". Document the trade-offs between cost, performance, and availability.

## Step 4: Create a Scaling Cost Calculator

Analyze the financial impact of scaling decisions over time:

```python
def calculate_scaling_timeline(current_vectors, growth_rate_monthly, optimization_factor):
    """Calculate when you'll need to scale and what it costs"""
    
    # Current capacity with optimization
    # Growth projection over 24 months  
    # Scaling trigger points
    # Cost comparison of strategies
    
    return scaling_analysis
```

**Your task**: Build a calculator that compares "optimize first" vs "scale early" strategies. Include real costs and timeline analysis. Show when it makes financial sense to scale horizontally vs optimize vertically.

## Success Criteria

You'll know you've succeeded when:

<input type="checkbox"> Your workload analyzer accurately calculates infrastructure requirements  
<input type="checkbox"> You've tested and compared memory optimization strategies with real data  
<input type="checkbox"> Your scaling simulator models realistic distributed deployment decisions  
<input type="checkbox"> You can make cost-informed scaling recommendations with timeline analysis  
<input type="checkbox"> You understand the trade-offs between optimization and scaling

## Deliverables

**Workload Analysis Report**: Requirements analysis for 3+ different scenarios
**Optimization Test Results**: Performance comparison of memory strategies
**Scaling Decision Framework**: Tool for evaluating distributed vs single-node deployments
**Cost Analysis**: Financial impact of different scaling approaches over time

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **At what point does horizontal scaling become more cost-effective than optimization?**
2. **How do different optimization strategies affect performance vs memory usage?**
3. **What are the real availability and cost trade-offs of 2-node vs 3-node clusters?**
4. **How do you calculate the true cost of distributed deployment including operational overhead?**

## Getting Started

1. **Start simple**: Build the workload analyzer first with basic memory calculations
2. **Test optimization**: Compare baseline vs optimized configurations in your free tier
3. **Model scaling**: Use your analysis to simulate when you'd need distributed deployment
4. **Calculate costs**: Build a timeline showing scaling decisions and their financial impact

The goal is to develop the analytical thinking that infrastructure engineers use to make scaling decisions, not to build a complete enterprise monitoring system. Focus on understanding the trade-offs and building tools that help you make informed decisions.
