# Qdrant Essentials Course

**From first vector to production‑grade retrieval in 9 days.**

Build the vector search skills that matter: hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, quantization, distributed deployment, and multitenancy. Ship a complete documentation search engine as your final project.

## What you'll learn
{{< course-card
 title="Skills you'll gain:"
 image="/icons/outline/training-white.svg"
 type="wide-list">}}

- Qdrant data modeling: points, payloads, and schemas
- Embeddings, chunking, and similarity metrics
- Indexing and retrieval tuning ([HNSW](https://qdrant.tech/articles/filtrable-hnsw/), filters, recall/latency)
- Hybrid search with sparse + dense vectors and re-ranking
- Performance optimization, compression, and quantization
- Scaling, sharding/replication, and security

{{< /course-card >}}

### The Path

**Days 0–2**: Foundations. Connect to Qdrant Cloud, understand points and payloads, compute semantic similarity with vectors, chunk text, and tune HNSW indexes for speed and recall.

**Days 3–5**: Advanced retrieval. Combine dense and sparse signals, implement hybrid search with server‑side fusion, master multivectors (ColBERT) and the Universal Query API, and build recommendation systems.

**Days 6–7**: Production deployment. Scale horizontally with sharding and replication, implement [JWT](https://jwt.io/)‑based multitenancy, configure quantization for 40× speedups, and secure production clusters.

**Day 8**: Ship it. Wire an end‑to‑end documentation search engine with ingestion, hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, and evaluation metrics (Recall@10, MRR, latency P50/P95).

**Day 9 (bonus)**: Ecosystem. Explore integrations with AI frameworks, search platforms, and data processing tools.
