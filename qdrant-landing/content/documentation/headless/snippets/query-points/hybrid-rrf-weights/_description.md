This code snippet demonstrates a hybrid search functionality that queries points from a collection using two prefetches. It showcases how to combine the results of multiple queries with different vector representations using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF), and custom weights. In this example, the first prefetch is assigned a weight of 3.0, and the second a weight of 1.0. The number of weights must match the number of prefetches.
