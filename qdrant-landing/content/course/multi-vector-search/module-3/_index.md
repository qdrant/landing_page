# Scalability and Optimization

Tackle the memory and performance challenges of production-scale multi-vector search.

---

## Today's path

1. Multi-Stage Retrieval with Universal Query API
2. Vector Quantization Techniques
3. Pooling Techniques
4. MUVERA
5. Evaluating Search Pipelines

You'll master the optimization strategies needed to deploy multi-vector search at scale. Eventually, you will utilize all the learned skills to build a real-world project implementing multi-vector search for multi-modal data.
