## Installation

The easiest way to use Qdrant is to run a pre-built image. To do this, make sure Docker is installed on your system.

Download image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/qdrant/qdrant):

```bash
docker pull qdrant/qdrant
```

And run the service inside the docker:

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
    -v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

In this case Qdrant will use default configuration and store all data under `./qdrant_storage` directory.

Now Qdrant should be accessible at [localhost:6333](http://localhost:6333)

## API

All interaction with Qdrant takes place via the REST API.

This example covers the most basic use-case - collection creation and basic vector search.
For additional information please refer to the [API documentation](https://qdrant.github.io/qdrant/redoc/index.html).

### gRPC

In addition to REST API, Qdrant also supports gRPC interface.
To enable gPRC interface, specify the following lines in the [configuration file](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/config/config.yaml):

```yaml
service:
  grpc_port: 6334
```

gRPC interface will be available on the specified port.
The gRPC methods follow the same principles as REST. For each REST endpoint, there is a corresponding gRPC method.
Documentation on all available gRPC methods and structures is available here - [gRPC Documentation](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/docs/grpc/docs.md).

The choice between gRPC and the REST API is a trade-off between convenience and speed.
gRPC is a binary protocol and can be more challenging to debug.
We recommend switching to it if you are already familiar with Qdrant and are trying to optimize the performance of your application.

If you are applying Qdrant for the first time or working on a prototype, you might prefer to use REST.

### Create collection
First - let's create a collection with dot-production metric.
```bash
curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "vector_size": 4,
        "distance": "Dot"
    }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "result": true,
    "status": "ok",
    "time": 0.031095451
}
```

We can ensure that collection was created:
```bash
curl 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection'
```

Expected response:

```
{
  "result": {
    "status": "green",
    "vectors_count": 0,
    "segments_count": 5,
    "disk_data_size": 0,
    "ram_data_size": 0,
    "config": {
      "params": {
        "vector_size": 4,
        "distance": "Dot"
      },
      "hnsw_config": { ... },
      "optimizer_config": { ... },
      "wal_config": { ... }
    }
  },
  "status": "ok",
  "time": 2.1199e-05
}
```


### Add points
Let's now add vectors with some payload:

```bash
curl -L -X PUT 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points?wait=true' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "points": [
          {"id": 1, "vector": [0.05, 0.61, 0.76, 0.74], "payload": {"city": "Berlin" }},
          {"id": 2, "vector": [0.19, 0.81, 0.75, 0.11], "payload": {"city": ["Berlin", "London"] }},
          {"id": 3, "vector": [0.36, 0.55, 0.47, 0.94], "payload": {"city": ["Berlin", "Moscow"] }},
          {"id": 4, "vector": [0.18, 0.01, 0.85, 0.80], "payload": {"city": ["London", "Moscow"] }},
          {"id": 5, "vector": [0.24, 0.18, 0.22, 0.44], "payload": {"count": [0] }},
          {"id": 6, "vector": [0.35, 0.08, 0.11, 0.44]}
        ]
    }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "result": {
        "operation_id": 0,
        "status": "completed"
    },
    "status": "ok",
    "time": 0.000206061
}
```

### Search with filtering

Let's start with a basic request:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points/search' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "vector": [0.2,0.1,0.9,0.7],
        "top": 3
    }'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
    "result": [
        { "id": 4, "score": 1.362 },
        { "id": 1, "score": 1.273 },
        { "id": 3, "score": 1.208 }
    ],
    "status": "ok",
    "time": 0.000055785
}
```

But result is different if we add a filter:

```bash
curl -L -X POST 'http://localhost:6333/collections/test_collection/points/search' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
      "filter": {
          "should": [
              {
                  "key": "city",
                  "match": {
                      "value": "London"
                  }
              }
          ]
      },
      "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
      "top": 3
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
    "result": [
        { "id": 4, "score": 1.362 },
        { "id": 2, "score": 0.871 }
    ],
    "status": "ok",
    "time": 0.000093972
}
```
