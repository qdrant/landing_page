## Migrating your data just got easier

We’ve launched the beta release of our Qdrant Migration Tool, designed to simplify moving data between Qdrant instances.

This tool streams all vectors from a collection in the source Qdrant instance to a target Qdrant instance. It supports migrations from one Qdrant deployment to another, including from open source to Qdrant Cloud or between cloud regions. All with a single command.

Unlike Qdrant’s included [snapshot migration method](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/snapshots/), which requires consistent node-specific snapshots, our migration tool enables you to easily migrate data between different Qdrant database clusters in streaming batches. The only requirement is that the vector size and distance function must match.

This is especially useful if you want to change the collection configuration on the target, for example by choosing a different replication factor or quantization method.

The easiest way to run the qdrant migration tool is as a container. You can run it any machine where you have connectivity to both the source and the target Qdrant databases. Direct connectivity between both databases is not required. For optimal performance, you should run the tool on a machine with a fast network connection and minimum latency to both databases.
