**Qdrant and OVHcloud Collaborate To Bring Vector Search to Startups and Enterprises in Europe With A Strong Focus on Data Control and Privacy**

With the official release of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, businesses running their data infrastructure on OVHcloud are now able to deploy a fully managed vector database in their existing OVHcloud environment. We are excited about this partnership, which has been established through the [OVHcloud Open Trusted Cloud](https://opentrustedcloud.ovhcloud.com/en/) program, as it is based on our shared understanding of the importance of trust, control, and data privacy in the context of the emerging landscape of enterprise-grade AI applications. As part of this collaboration, we are also providing a detailed use case tutorial on building a recommendation system with ‘collaborative filtering using sparse vectors’ that demonstrates the benefits of running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud.

Deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud's infrastructure represents a significant leap for European businesses invested in AI-driven projects, as this collaboration underscores the commitment to meeting the rigorous requirements for data privacy and control of European startups and enterprises building AI solutions. As businesses are progressing on their AI journey, they require dedicated solutions that allow them to make their data accessible for machine learning and AI projects, without having it leave the company's security perimeter. Prioritizing data sovereignty, a crucial aspect in today's digital landscape, will help startups and enterprises accelerate their AI agenda’s and build even more differentiating AI-enabled applications. The ability of running Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud not only underscores the commitment to innovative, secure AI solutions but also ensures that companies can navigate the complexities of AI and machine learning workloads with the flexibility and security required.

**Qdrant & OVHcloud: High Performance Vector Search With Full Data Control**

Through the seamless integration between Qdrant Hybrid Cloud and OVHcloud, developers and businesses are able to deploy the fully managed vector database within their existing OVHcloud setups in minutes, enabling faster, more accurate AI-driven insights.

- **Simple setup:** With the seamless “one-click” installation, developers are able to deploy Qdrant’s fully managed vector database to their existing OVHcloud environment.
- **Trust and data sovereignty**: Deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on OVHcloud enables developers with vector search that prioritizes data sovereignty, a crucial aspect in today's AI landscape where data privacy and control are essential. True to its “Sovereign by design” DNA, OVHcloud guarantees that all the data stored are immune to extraterritorial laws and comply with the highest security standards.
- **Open standards and open ecosystem**: OVHcloud’s commitment to open standards and an open ecosystem not only facilitates the easy integration of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud with OVHcloud’s AI services and GPU-powered instances but also ensures compatibility with a wide range of external services and applications, enabling seamless data workflows across the modern AI stack.
- **Cost efficient sector search:** By leveraging Qdrant's quantization for efficient data handling and pairing it with OVHcloud's eco-friendly, water-cooled infrastructure, known for its superior price/performance ratio, this collaboration provides a strong foundation for cost efficient vector search.

**Build a Recommendation System with Collaborative Filtering Using Sparse Vectors with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud and OVHcloud**
