description: This GitHub demo showcases a proof-of-concept for smart glasses that can remember what they see and help you find objects, like your keys, even when fully offline. It runs Qdrant Edge directly on the device, using a vision-language model to convert video frames into vectors for fast, local search while skipping redundant frames to stay efficient.
description2: See how vector search can bring memory-like capabilities to resource-constrained hardware at the edge.
