This code snippet demonstrates how to create an index for an integer field within a collection. The index can be fine-tuned for improved performance by specifying whether direct lookup and range filters are enabled. In this case, a parameterized variant of the integer index is set up to support only range filters, which can be beneficial for collections with a large number of data points. It is recommended to experiment with the parameterized index to optimize performance, and if needed, revert back to the regular integer index. Be cautious when setting up both direct lookup and range filters, as it may impact performance negatively.
