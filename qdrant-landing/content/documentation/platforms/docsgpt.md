# DocsGPT

[DocsGPT](https://docsgpt.arc53.com/) is an open-source documentation assistant that enables you to build conversational user experiences on top of your data.

Qdrant is supported as a vectorstore in DocsGPT to ingest and semantically retrieve documents.

## Configuration

Learn how to setup DocsGPT in their [Quickstart guide](https://docs.docsgpt.co.uk/Deploying/Quickstart).

You can configure DocsGPT with environment variables in a `.env` file.

To configure DocsGPT to use Qdrant as the vector store, set `VECTOR_STORE` to `"qdrant"`.

```bash
echo "VECTOR_STORE=qdrant" >> .env
```

DocsGPT includes a list of the Qdrant configuration options that you can set as environment variables [here](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/00dfb07b15602319bddb95089e3dab05fac56240/application/core/settings.py#L46-L59).
