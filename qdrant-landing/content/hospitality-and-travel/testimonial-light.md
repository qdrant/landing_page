review: “Qdrant has been crucial for our transformation. When you're dealing with over a billion plus user-generated, multi-modal pieces of content from hundreds of millions of monthly active users across 21 countries, 11M businesses and all the complex user interactions that come with it, you need a way to bring it all together. Now, we can represent everything from hotel preferences to restaurant choices to user behavior in a unified way. And we’re seeing real business results. Users engaging with our AI-powered features like trip planning are showing 2-3x more revenue.”
