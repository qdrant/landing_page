{{< youtube "IVfoVS0KfPM" >}}

## What You'll Learn

- Data lake architecture with vectors
- Large-scale data management
- Analytics and vector search integration
- ETL pipeline optimization
- Knowledge graph creation from unstructured documents
- Document parsing and structured data extraction
- LangGraph agent integration for natural language querying

## TensorLake Knowledge Graph Integration

TensorLake introduces an innovative approach to enhancing Qdrant collection querying through advanced document parsing and knowledge graph creation. The platform transforms unstructured documents into structured knowledge graphs, providing comprehensive data extraction and intelligent summarization of complex tables and figures, leading to more accurate embeddings and fine-tuned searches in RAG applications.

### Core Architecture

TensorLake's document parsing engine provides several key capabilities:

- **Knowledge Graph Creation**: Transforms unstructured documents into structured knowledge graphs with preserved relationships
- **Document Layout Preservation**: Maintains reading order and groups related content like authors and references
- **Table and Figure Summarization**: Creates intelligent summaries of complex tables and figures for semantic searchability
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Extracts metadata including titles, authors, conferences, keywords, and references

### Academic Research Paper Processing

The demonstration showcases TensorLake's capabilities using academic research papers:

1. **Document Parsing**:
   - TensorLake's engine preserves reading order and document structure
   - Groups authors and creates complete document layout
   - Extracts structured metadata from research papers

2. **Knowledge Graph Generation**:
   - Creates comprehensive knowledge graphs from parsed documents
   - Maintains relationships between authors, institutions, and references
   - Preserves hierarchical document structure

3. **Table and Figure Processing**:
   - Summarizes complex tables and figures for embedding
   - Makes large tables semantically searchable
   - Enables fine-grained queries on tabular data

### Qdrant Integration Workflow

The complete integration process follows these steps:

1. **Document Processing with TensorLake**:
   - Parse documents to extract structured information
   - Generate knowledge graphs with preserved relationships
   - Create summaries of tables and figures

2. **Embedding Creation and Storage**:
   - Create embeddings from processed document content
   - Generate detailed payloads including title, authors, conference, keywords, and references
   - Upsert embeddings and metadata into Qdrant collections

3. **Index Creation**:
   - Create indices for easier filtering by metadata attributes
   - Optimize collections for both semantic search and metadata filtering
   - Enable efficient querying across different data types

4. **LangGraph Agent Integration**:
   - Implement natural language querying capabilities
   - Enable intelligent filtering based on query context
   - Provide summaries of relevant document sections

### Advanced Query Capabilities

The system supports multiple query types:

- **Simple Semantic Queries**: Basic vector similarity search without filtering
- **Filtered Queries**: Search by specific authors, conferences, or other metadata
- **Combined Queries**: Semantic search with metadata filtering for precise results
- **Natural Language Queries**: LangGraph agent interprets complex questions and applies appropriate filters

### Key Benefits

TensorLake's integration with Qdrant provides several advantages:

- **Enhanced Accuracy**: More accurate embeddings through structured data extraction
- **Complete Document Understanding**: Preserves document hierarchy and relationships
- **Fine-tuned Search**: Enables precise queries combining semantic and metadata filtering
- **Robust Collections**: More complete and reliable query results
- **Natural Language Interface**: Intuitive querying through LangGraph agents

### Real-World Applications

This architecture enables various advanced use cases:

- **Research Discovery**: Finding relevant academic papers with complex criteria
- **Legal Document Analysis**: Processing contracts and legal documents with structured extraction
- **Technical Documentation**: Creating searchable knowledge bases from technical manuals
- **Enterprise Knowledge Management**: Building comprehensive search systems for large document collections
