We're happy to announce the collaboration between LlamaIndex and Qdrant’s new Hybrid Cloud launch, aimed at empowering engineers and scientists worldwide to swiftly and securely develop and scale their GenAI applications. By leveraging LlamaIndex's robust framework, users can maximize the potential of vector search and create stable and effective AI products. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud offers the same Qdrant functionality on a Kubernetes-based architecture, which further expands the ability of LlamaIndex to support any user on any environment.

With Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, users have the flexibility to deploy their vector database in an environment of their choice. By using container-based scalable deployments, companies can leverage a cutting-edge framework like LlamaIndex, while staying deployed in the same hosting architecture as data sources, embedding models and LLMs. This powerful combination empowers organizations to build strong and secure applications that search, understand meaning and converse in text.

While LLMs are trained on a great deal of data, they are not trained on user-specific data, which may be private or highly specific. LlamaIndex meets this challenge by adding context to LLM-based generation methods. In turn, Qdrant’s popular vector database sorts through semantically relevant information, which can further enrich the performance gains from LlamaIndex’s data connection features. With LlamaIndex, users can tap into state-of-the-art functions to query, chat, sort or parse data. Through the integration of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud and LlamaIndex developers can conveniently vectorize their data and perform highly accurate semantic search - all within their own environment.

> *“LlamaIndex is thrilled to partner with Qdrant on the launch of Qdrant Hybrid Cloud, which upholds Qdrant's core functionality within a Kubernetes-based architecture. This advancement enhances LlamaIndex's ability to support diverse user environments, facilitating the development and scaling of production-grade, context-augmented LLM applications.”* Jerry Liu, CEO and Co-Founder, LlamaIndex

#### Reap the Benefits of Advanced Integration Features With Qdrant and LlamaIndex

Building apps with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud and LlamaIndex comes with several key advantages:

**Seamless Deployment:** Qdrant Hybrid Cloud’s Kubernetes-native architecture lets you deploy Qdrant in a few clicks, to an environment of your choice. Combined with the flexibility afforded by LlamaIndex, users can put together advanced RAG solutions anyplace at minimal effort.

**Open-Source Compatibility:** LlamaIndex and Qdrant pride themselves on maintaining a reliable and mature integration that brings peace of mind to those prototyping and deploying large-scale AI solutions. Extensive documentation, code samples and tutorials support users of all skill levels in leveraging highly advanced features of data ingestion and vector search.

**Advanced Search Features:** LlamaIndex comes with built-in Qdrant Hybrid Search functionality, which combines search results from sparse and dense vectors. As a highly sought-after use case, hybrid search is easily accessible from within the LlamaIndex ecosystem. Deploying this particular type vector search on Hybrid Cloud is a matter of a few lines of code.

#### Start Building With LlamaIndex and Qdrant Hybrid Cloud: Hybrid Search in Complex PDF Documentation Use Cases

To get you started, we created a comprehensive tutorial that shows how to build next-gen AI applications with Qdrant Hybrid Cloud using the LlamaIndex framework and the LlamaParse API.
