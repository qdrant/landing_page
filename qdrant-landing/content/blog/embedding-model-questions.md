## Choosing the Right Model is a Long-Term Investment

This decision goes beyond immediate performance—it’s a long-term investment in the scalability and flexibility of your system. Embedding models turn unstructured data into vectors, powering efficient and accurate RAG processes.

With many models to choose from, each with different strengths, the decision comes down to factors like efficiency, accuracy, and specialization. 

- **Efficiency**: Some models like ResNet-50 are lightweight and fast, ideal for mobile apps.
- **Accuracy**: CLIP excels at understanding both text and images, offering versatile use cases.
- **Specialization**: BM25 focuses on keyword relevance, ideal for traditional search systems.

Each model has its unique strengths—some prioritize speed, others handle multimodal data or specialized search tasks. Understanding these differences will help you make an informed choice that sets your system up for long-term success.

In this article, we’ll walk you through setting up models with FastEmbed, share real-world examples, and show you how to experiment with different options. By the end, you’ll know which model is best for your application and how to implement it.

## Top Five Use Cases and Recommended Embedding Models 

To streamline your workflow, we will focus on five embedding models from FastEmbed, covering both image and text embeddings. Each model comes with a simple use case, setup example, and demo link to experiment with.



### 1. Text Embedding for Short Documents - BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 
**Ideal Use Case:** Social Media Moderation
Real-time content moderation on social media platforms.

**Model Info**: Lightweight, fast model for short English text, supporting 384 dimensions and is 0.067 GB.

```python
from fastembed import BGEEmbed
embedder = BGEEmbed(model="small-en-v1.5")
text_vector = embedder.embed("short_text_here")
```

**Demo**: [Try BGE for text embeddings](#)

### 2. **CLIP ViT-B-32 (Image & Text Embedding)**
**Ideal Use Case:** Text-to-Image Search.
CLIP creates joint embeddings for text and images. It’s 0.34 GB and supports 512-dimensional embeddings.

**Example**: Search for images with natural language (e.g., "a dog playing in a park").

```python
from fastembed import CLIP
embedder = CLIP(model='ViT-B-32')
image_vector = embedder.embed_image("your_image.jpg")
text_vector = embedder.embed_text("a dog playing in a park")
```

### 3. **Qdrant/BM25 (Sparse Embedding for Keyword Search)**
**Ideal Use Case:** Keyword-Based Document Search
BM25 computes sparse embeddings, great for traditional keyword searches. Ideal for enterprise document search engines.

**Example**: Searching a repository for documents with specific keywords.

```python
from fastembed import BM25
bm25 = BM25()
search_results = bm25.search("keyword query")
```

**Demo**: [Explore BM25 for document search](#)

### 5. **prithvida/Splade_PP_en_v1 (Sparse + Dense Hybrid Embedding)**
**Ideal Use Case:** E-commerce Product Search
Combines sparse lexical features and dense representations, suitable for hybrid search tasks.

**Example**: Searching an e-commerce platform with keywords and descriptive phrases.

```python
from fastembed import SPLADE
embedder = SPLADE()
results = embedder.search("red running shoes")
```

**Demo**: [Play with SPLADE for hybrid search](#)

### 5. **ResNet-50 (Image Embedding)**
**Ideal Use Case:** Lightweight Mobile App
Organizing photos on a mobile device into categories like "Landscapes" or "Portraits."

**Model Info**: ResNet-50 uses CNNs and residual learning. It’s compact (0.1 GB) and supports 2048-dimensional embeddings.

```python
from fastembed import ResNet50Embed
embedder = ResNet50Embed()
image_vector = embedder.embed("your_image.jpg")
```

**Demo**: [Play with ResNet-50 here](#)
