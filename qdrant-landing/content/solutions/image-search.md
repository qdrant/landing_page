Sometimes text search is not enough. Qdrant vector database allows you to find similar images, detect duplicates, or even find a picture by text description. 

Qdrant filters enable you to apply arbitrary business logic on top of a similarity search.
Look for similar clothes cheaper than $20? Search for a similar artwork published in the last year?
Qdrant handles all possible conditions!

For the Demo, we put together a food discovery service - it will show you a lunch suggestion based on what you visually like or dislike. It can also search for a place near you.
