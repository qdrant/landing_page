# Configuring Networking, Logging & Monitoring in Qdrant Hybrid Cloud

## Configure network policies

For security reasons, each database cluster is secured with network policies. By default, database pods only allow egress traffic between each other and ingress traffic to ports 6333 (REST) and 6334 (gRPC) from within the Kubernetes cluster.

You can modify the default network policies in the Hybrid Cloud environment configuration:

```yaml
qdrant:
  networkPolicies:
    ingress:
    - from:
      - ipBlock:
          cidr: 192.168.0.0/22
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: client-app
        namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: client-namespace
      - podSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: traefik
        namespaceSelector:
          matchLabels:
            kubernetes.io/metadata.name: kube-system
      ports:
      - port: 6333
        protocol: TCP
      - port: 6334
        protocol: TCP      
```

## Logging

You can access the logs with kubectl or the Kubernetes log management tool of your choice. For example:

```bash
kubectl -n qdrant-namespace logs -l app=qdrant,cluster-id=9a9f48c7-bb90-4fb2-816f-418a46a74b24
```

**Configuring log levels:** You can configure log levels for the databases individually in the configuration section of the Qdrant Cluster detail page. The log level for the **Qdrant Cloud Agent** and **Operator** can be set in the [Hybrid Cloud Environment configuration](/documentation/hybrid-cloud/operator-configuration/).

### Integrating with a log management system

You can integrate the logs into any log management system that supports Kubernetes. There are no Qdrant specific configurations necessary. Just configure the agents of your system to collect the logs from all Pods in the Qdrant namespace.

## Monitoring

The Qdrant Cloud console gives you access to basic metrics about CPU, memory and disk usage of your Qdrant clusters.

If you want to integrate Qdrant metrics into your own monitoring system, configure it to scrape the following endpoints, which provide metrics in a Prometheus/OpenMetrics-compatible format:

* `/metrics` on port 6333 of every Qdrant database Pod. This provides metrics about each database and its internals.
* `/metrics` on port 9290 of the Qdrant Operator Pod. This provides metrics about the Operator, as well as the status of Qdrant clusters and snapshots.
* `/metrics` on port 9090 of the Qdrant Cloud Agent Pod. This provides metrics about the Agent and its connection to the Qdrant Cloud control plane.
* `/metrics` on port 8080 of the [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) Pod. This provides metrics about the state of Kubernetes resources like Pods and PersistentVolumes within the Qdrant Hybrid Cloud namespace and is useful if you are not running kube-state-metrics cluster-wide.

### Grafana dashboard

If you scrape the above metrics into your own monitoring system, and you are using Grafana, you can use our [Grafana dashboard](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-cloud-grafana-dashboard) to visualize these metrics.
