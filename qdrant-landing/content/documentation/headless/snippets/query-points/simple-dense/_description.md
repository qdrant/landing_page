You can utilize the Query API in Qdrant to perform various types of searches. One of the key functionalities is the Nearest Neighbors Search, which enables you to find vector similarity between points using k-NN algorithm. The API allows for searching by id, providing recommendations with positive and negative examples, conducting discovery searches, scrolling through points with optional filtering, grouping results, ordering points by payload key, performing hybrid searches, optimizing performance for large embeddings with multi-stage search, and getting random points from the collection.
