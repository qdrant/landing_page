In the world of resource-constrained computing, a quiet revolution is taking place. While transformers dominate 
leaderboards with their impressive capabilities, static embeddings are making an unexpected comeback, offering 
remarkable speed improvements with surprisingly small quality trade-offs. **We evaluated how Qdrant users can benefit
from this renaissance, and the results are promising**.

## What makes static embeddings different?

Transformers are often seen as the only way to go when it comes to embeddings. The use of attention mechanisms helps to 
capture the relationships between the input tokens, so each token gets a vector representation that is context-aware
and defined not only by the token itself but also by the surrounding tokens. Transformer-based models easily beat the 
quality of the older methods, such as word2vec or GloVe, which could only create a single vector embedding per each 
word. As a result, the word "bank" would have identical representation in the context of "river bank" and "financial 
institution".

Transformer-based models would represent the word "bank" differently in each of the contexts. However, transformers come 
with a cost. They are computationally expensive and usually require a lot of memory, although the embeddings models 
usually have fewer parameters than the Large Language Models. Still, GPUs are preferred to be used, even for inference. 

Static embeddings are still a thing, though! [MinishLab](https://minishlab.github.io/) introduced their [model2vec 
technique](https://huggingface.co/blog/Pringled/model2vec) in October 2024, achieving a remarkable 15x reduction in 
model size and up to 500x speed increase while maintaining impressive performance levels. Their idea was to distill the 
knowledge from the transformer-based sentence transformer and create a static embedding model that would be much faster 
and less memory-consuming. This introduction seems to be a catalyst for the static embeddings renaissance, as we can see 
static embeddings to be integrated even into popular [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library. The 
[recent blog post on the Hugging Face blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/static-embeddings) by [Tom 
Aarsen](https://www.tomaarsen.com) reveals how to train a static embedding model using Sentence Transformers and still
get up to 85% of transformer-level quality at a fraction of computational cost. The blog post also introduces an 
embedding model for English text retrieval, which is called `static-retrieval-mrl-en-v1`.

## Static embeddings in Qdrant

From the vector database perspective, static embeddings are not different from any other embedding models. They are 
dense vectors after all, and you can simply store them in a Qdrant collection. Here is how you do it with the 
`sentence-transformers/static-retrieval-mrl-en-v1` model:

```python
import uuid

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

# The model produces vectors of size 1024
model = SentenceTransformer(
    "sentence-transformers/static-retrieval-mrl-en-v1"
)

# Let's assume we have a collection "my_collection" 
# with a single vector called "static"
client = QdrantClient("http://localhost:6333")

# Calling the sentence transformer model to encode 
# the text is not different compared to any other model
client.upsert(
    "my_collection",
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=uuid.uuid4().hex,
            vector=model.encode("Hello, world!"),
            payload={"static": "Hello, world!"},
        )
    ]
)
```

The retrieval is not going to be any faster just because you use static embeddings. However, **you will experience a 
huge speedup in creating the vectors from your data**, what is usually a bottleneck. The Hugging Face blog post mentions 
that the model might be even up to 400x faster on a CPU than the state-of-the-art embedding model. 

We didn't perform any proper benchmarking of the encoding speed, but one of the experiments done on `TREC-COVID` dataset 
from [BeIR](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir) shows that we can **encode and fully index 171K documents in Qdrant in 
around 7.5 minutes**. All of it done on a consumer-grade laptop, without GPU acceleration.

## Quantization of the static embeddings

What can actually make the retrieval faster is the use of Matryoshka Embeddings, as the `static-retrieval-mrl-en-v1` 
model was trained with that technique in mind. However, that's not the only way to speed up search. Quantization
methods are really popular among our users, and we were curious to check if they might be applied to the static 
embeddings with the same success.

We took the `static-retrieval-mrl-en-v1` model and tested it on various subsets of 
[BeIR](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir) with and without Binary Quantization, to see how much if affects the 
retrieval quality. The results are really promising, as shown in our NDCG@10 measurements (a metric that evaluates the 
ranking quality of search results, with higher scores indicating better performance):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th colspan="2" style="text-align: center">NDCG@10</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Dataset</th>
            <th>Original vectors</th>
            <th>Binary Quantization, no rescoring</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>SciFact</th>
            <td><u>0.59348</u></td>
            <td>0.54195</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>TREC-COVID</th>
            <td><u>0.4428</u></td>
            <td>0.44185</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>ArguAna</th>
            <td><u>0.44393</u></td>
            <td>0.42164</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>NFCorpus</th>
            <td><u>0.30045</u></td>
            <td>0.28027</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Binary Quantization definitely speeds up the retrieval, and make it cheaper, but also seems not to affect the quality of 
the retrieval much in some cases. **However, that's something you should carefully verify on your own data**. If you are 
a Qdrant user, then you can just enable quantization on an existing collection and [measure the impact on the retrieval 
quality](/documentation/beginner-tutorials/retrieval-quality/).

All the tests we did were performed using [`beir-qdrant`](https://github.com/kacperlukawski/beir-qdrant), and might be
reproduced by running [the script available on the project 
repo](https://github.com/kacperlukawski/beir-qdrant/blob/main/examples/retrieval/search/evaluate_static_embeddings.py).

## Who should use static embeddings?

Static embeddings seem to be a budget-friendly option for those who would like to use semantic search in their 
applications, but can't afford hosting standard representation models, or cannot do it, i.e. due to hardware 
constraints. Some of the use cases might be:

- **Mobile applications** - although many smartphones have powerful CPUs or even GPUs, the battery life is still a 
  concern, and the static embeddings might be a good compromise between the quality and the power consumption. Moreover,
  the static embeddings can be used in the applications that require offline mode.
- **Web browser extensions** - running a transformer-based model in a web browser is usually not quite an option, but 
  static embeddings might be a good choice, as they have fewer parameters and are faster to encode.
- **Embedded systems** - the static embeddings might be a good choice for the devices with limited computational power, 
  such as IoT devices or microcontrollers.

If you are one of the above, then you should definitely give static embeddings a try. **However, if the search quality
is not the top of your priorities, then you might consider using static embeddings even in the high-performance
environments**. The speedup in the encoding process might be a game-changer for you.

### Customization of the static embeddings

Last, but not least. The training pipeline published by [Tom Aarsen](https://www.tomaarsen.com) can help you to train
your own static embeddings models, so **you can adjust it the specifics of your data easily**. This training process 
will also be way faster than for a transformer-based model, so you can even retrain it more often. Recomputing the 
embeddings is a bottleneck of the semantic search systems, and the static embeddings might be a good solution to this 
problem. Whether a custom static embedding model can beat a general pre-trained model remains an open question, but it's 
definitely worth trying.
