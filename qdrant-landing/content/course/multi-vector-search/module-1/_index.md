## Today's path

1. Late Interaction Basics
2. MaxSim Distance Metric
3. Use Cases for Multi-Vector Search
4. Problems of Multi-Vector Search
5. Multi-Vector Embeddings in Qdrant

You'll understand when multi-vector representations outperform traditional single-vector embeddings, and what kind of
problems to expect when you start working with multi-vector search at scale.
