This code snippet demonstrates how to create a full-text index with ASCII folding support for a specified field in a collection. The index configuration includes details such as the field name, type (text), tokenizer (word), and whether to ASCII-fold tokens. This setup enables filtering points based on the presence of specific words while ignoring diacritics in the field, allowing for efficient full-text search functionality within the payload.
