Enable the IDF modifier for a specific collection to leverage the Inverse Document Frequency statistics automatically in Qdrant. By setting this modifier in the collection configuration, the search algorithm would prioritize items that occur less frequently in the collection, making them more significant in search results ranking. This feature is particularly useful for text search engines to enhance search relevance based on word rarity within the collection.
