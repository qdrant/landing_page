This code snippet illustrates how to use the OpenRouter API for ingest-time inference on Qdrant Cloud. The example upserts a point, but instead of providing an explicit vector, the request includes text along with the name of the `openrouter/mistralai/mistral-embed-2312` model. When the model name is prepended with `openrouter/`, the Qdrant Cloud Inference proxy uses the OpenRouter API to infer embeddings out of the provided text. Qdrant will store the resulting vector. The request also shows how to pass OpenRouter-specific parameters to the API. In this case, the request provides the OpenRouter API key and the `dimensions` parameter.
