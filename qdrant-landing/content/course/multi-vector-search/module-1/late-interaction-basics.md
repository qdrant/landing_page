# Late Interaction Basics

Traditional dense embedding models compress entire documents into single vectors. The late interaction paradigm takes a different approach: it represents documents as sets of token-level vectors and delays the interaction computation until search time.

This fundamental shift enables more nuanced matching between queries and documents, capturing fine-grained semantic relationships that single vectors might miss.
