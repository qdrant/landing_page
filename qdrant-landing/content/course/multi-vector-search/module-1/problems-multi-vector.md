# Problems of Multi-Vector Search

Multi-vector search delivers impressive retrieval quality, but it comes with significant challenges. Before deploying multi-vector search in production, you need to understand these limitations and plan accordingly.

The good news: Module 3 covers optimization techniques that address many of these challenges.
