When creating a collection with vectors and HNSW index stored on disk, it is recommended to set the `memmap_threshold` parameter based on your use case. For a balanced scenario, keep it equal to the `indexing_threshold` (default is 20000) to optimize all thresholds at once. If facing high write load and low RAM, set `memmap_threshold` lower than `indexing_threshold`, for example 10000, to prioritize converting segments to memmap storage before indexing. Remember, you can store both vectors and the HNSW index on disk by setting `hnsw_config.on_disk` to `true` during collection creation or updating.
