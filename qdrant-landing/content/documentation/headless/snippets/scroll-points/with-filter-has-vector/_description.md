Searches for points within a specified collection based on the dense `image` vector. It filters points by searching for those that have the particular vector named `image`. Points may have a variety of vectors; this filter narrows the search to points with the specific `image` vector defined. If your collection does not have named vectors, ensure to use an empty string (`""`) as the name for filtering.
