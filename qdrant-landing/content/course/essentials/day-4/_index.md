# Optimization and Scale

Compression, advanced tuning, and high‑throughput ingestion.

---

## Today’s path

1. Vector compression techniques
2. Advanced optimization
3. Large‑scale ingestion
4. Pitstop: 40× performance with quantization

You’ll compare memory footprint, recall, and throughput across configurations.
