This code snippet demonstrates a POST request that filters through a collection of points based on nested conditions. It showcases how to filter points based on specific criteria within nested objects. In this case, the filter looks for points where a nested object with the key "diet" contains sub-objects that match the conditions specified for "food" and "likes". The snippet illustrates the concept of nested object filters, enabling the querying of arrays of objects independently.
