## Article preview

Article preview is a set of images that will be used in the article preview. They can be generated from one image. To generate preview images, you need to have [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) and [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) installed.

You can install `cwebp` with the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Intervox/node-webp/latest/bin/install_webp | sudo bash
```

### Prepare preview image

For the preview use image with the aspect ratio 3 to 1 in jpg or png format. With resolution not smaller than 1200x630px. The image should illustrate in some way the article's core idea. Fill free got creative. Check out that most important part of the image is in the center.

### Generating preview images

To generate preview images, run the following command from the root of project:

```bash
bash -x automation/process-article-img.sh <path-to-image> <alias-for-the-article>
```

For example:

```bash
bash -x automation/process-article-img.sh ~/Pictures/my_preview.jpg filtrable-hnsw 
```

This command will create a directory `preview` in `static/article_data/filtrable-hnsw` and generate preview images in it. If the directory `static/article_data/filtrable-hnsw` doesn't exist, it will be created. If it exists, only files in children `preview` directory will be affected. In this case preview images will be overwritten. Your original image will not be affected.

### Preview images set

Preview images set consists of the following images:

`preview.jpg` - 530x145px (used on the article preview card **for browsers, not supporting webp**)
`preview.webp` - 530x145px (used on the article preview card **for browsers, supporting webp**)
`title.jpg` - 898x300px (used on the article's page as the main image before the article title **for browsers, not supporting webp**)
`title.webp` - 898x300px (used on the article's page as the main image before the article title **for browsers, supporting webp**)
`social_preview.jpg` - 1200x630px (used in social media previews)

## Documentation sidebar

### Delimiter

To create a delimiter in the sidebar, use the following command:

``` bash
cd qdrant-landing
hugo new --kind delimiter documentation/<delimiter-title>.md
```

It will create a file `content/documentation/<delimiter-title>.md`.

To put a delimiter to desired place in the sidebar, set the `weight` parameter to the desired value. The lower the value, the higher the delimiter will be in the sidebar.

### External link

To create an external link in the sidebar, use the following command:

``` bash
cd qdrant-landing
hugo new --kind external-link documentation/<link-title>.md
```

It will create a file `content/documentation/<link-title>.md`. Open it and set the `external_link` parameter to the desired value.
