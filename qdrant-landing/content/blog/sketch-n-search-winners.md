Builders from around the world came together for Sketch & Search, a global hackathon powered by Google DeepMind, Freepik, and Qdrant, to explore the future of AI-driven creative pipelines.

Teams were challenged to go beyond single-prompt generation and build end-to-end systems combining generative models, visual creation, and vector search. Submissions showcased consistent characters and style memory, image-as-prompt and image-to-video workflows, intelligent asset discovery, recommendations, and built-in brand-safe guardrails.

The hackathon kicked off in San Francisco on November 22, 2025, followed by a two-week virtual build window and a live demo day where winners were announced. Projects were judged on creative quality, effective search and similarity, UX tradeoffs, guardrails, and real-world applicability.

With over $25,000 in prizes, including cash awards and Gemini API credits, Sketch & Search highlighted how generation, search, and creativity come together to power production-ready applications.

Let’s dive into the top projects and what we liked about each of them.

## 🏆 Overall Winners

### 🥇 1st Place: Prometheus (Harry Kabodha)

**Bonus Prize: Best use of Gemini**  
**Total Prize: `$1500 USD Cash & 500 Gift Card` \+ `$10000 Gemini API Credits`**

**What it is:** Prometheus turns a PDB file (molecule format) into a cinematic, structure-faithful “mechanism trailer” for scientists and biotech storytellers. Gemini interprets the protein (domains, active site, flexible regions) and writes shot prompts grounded by Mol* renders. Qdrant searches your prior targets to reuse the best prompt/camera templates, then stores what works to build an institutional “visual memory.” Nano Banana generates consistent keyframes, and Freepik stitches them into a short animation ready for decks, talks, and internal knowledge bases.

**Stack:** Gemini/Flash, Nano Banana, Qdrant, Freepik

### 🥈 2nd Place: Roast My Snack (Jay Ozer)

**Total Prize: `$500 Cash & 300 Gift Card`**

**What it is:** "Roast My Snack transforms snack photos into 4-panel comics where Dr. Hawley — a Gen-Z molar with Adult Swim energy — roasts your snack's ""aesthetic threat level"" to your smile. The insight: Telling teens ""sugar causes cavities"" doesn't work. But ""that snack is gonna turn your smile yellow""? That lands.
We use vanity as a force for good. Built with Gemini Vision, Qdrant semantic search, and clinic-validated dental science from Poppy Kids Pediatric Dentistry. Age-adaptive roasts (Spicy for tweens, Savage for teens), transparent risk scoring, and Instagram-ready exports. Dental education kids actually want to share."

**Stack:** Gemini/Flash, Nano Banana, Qdrant, Freepik

### 🥉 3rd Place: AutoScape (Tommy Purcell & Rae Jin)

**Bonus Prize: Best use of Nano Banana** 

**Total Prize: `$250 Cash & 150 Gift Card` \+ `$10,000 Gemini API Credits`**

**What it is:** AutoScape is an AI-powered landscape design platform that takes you from a single photo to a build-ready outdoor project. But it's more than a generic image generation tool. AutoScape is a full platform for homeowners, designers, contractors, and public-sector teams working on residential, commercial, or civic spaces. AutoScape produces photorealistic designs, materials lists, and labor cost estimates with product links, exportable to Excel or Google Sheets. Designs can be shared for collaboration. Unlike generic AI tools, AutoScape uses a Qdrant-powered RAG system and curated plant database grounded in real materials and pricing. A public gallery enables inspiration and reuse globally.

## Why These Projects Matter

These projects show what happens when developers apply vector retrieval to creative, scientific, and real-world workflows:
- Molecular structures transformed into cinematic, reusable scientific storytelling.
- Educational experiences that use humor, memory, and personalization to change behavior.
- Image-to-design pipelines that turn a single photo into production-ready plans.
- Creative systems that learn what works and build long-term visual memory.
- Search-driven reuse of styles, prompts, and assets across domains.
- Practical applications where embeddings connect data, visuals, and human intent.

As with any hackathon, there were tons of amazing submissions, and we wish we could showcase them all, but we hope this sample showcases the strong power of the Qdrant Community when tasked with new challenges and creative approaches.
