# Qdrant Essentials

**Ship a production-ready docs search in 7 days**

Build the vector search skills that matter: hybrid retrieval, multivector reranking, quantization, distributed deployment, and multitenancy. Ship a complete documentation search engine as your final project.

## What you'll learn
{{< course-card
 title="Skills you'll gain:"
 image="/icons/outline/training-white.svg"
 type="wide-list">}}

- Qdrant data modeling: points, payloads, and schemas
- Embeddings, chunking, and similarity metrics
- Indexing and retrieval tuning (HNSW, filters, recall/latency)
- Hybrid search with sparse + dense vectors and re-ranking
- Performance optimization, compression, and quantization
- Scaling, sharding/replication, and security

{{< /course-card >}}

### The Path

**Days 0-2**: Foundations. Connect to Qdrant Cloud, work with points and payloads, compute semantic similarity, chunk text, and tune HNSW for speed and recall.

**Days 3-5**: Advanced retrieval. Combine dense and sparse signals, do hybrid search with server-side fusion, use multivectors (ColBERT) with the Universal Query API, and build recommendations.

**Day 6**: Ship. Wire ingestion, hybrid retrieval, multivector re-ranking, and evaluation (Recall@10, MRR, latency P50/P95).

**Day 7 (bonus)**: Ecosystem. Try integrations with AI frameworks, search tools, and data pipelines.
