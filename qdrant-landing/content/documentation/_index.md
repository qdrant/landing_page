# Qdrant Documentation

Qdrant (read: quadrant ) is a vector similarity search engine. It provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points - vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant is tailored to extended filtering support. It makes it useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications.


Qdrant is released under the open-source Apache License 2.0. Its source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant).

## Overview

Qdrant is ideal for deploying applications based on the matching of embeddings produced by neural network encoders.

These can be:

- Semantic search
- Similar Image \ Audio \ Video search
- Recommendation systems
