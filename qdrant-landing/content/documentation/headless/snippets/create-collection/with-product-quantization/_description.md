This code snippet is configuring a collection with product quantization. It defines the vector size and distance metric for vectors in the collection, and specifies parameters for product quantization such as compression and storage settings. It highlights the process of setting up product quantization and mentions the specific details to include in the configuration. It also suggests using a PATCH request or the corresponding method for updating an existing collection without modifying the vector configuration.
