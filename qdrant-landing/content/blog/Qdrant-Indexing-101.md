# Qdrant Indexing 101: Why You Should Create Payload Indexes *Before* Uploading Data

## Avoid rebuilding costs and boost query performance with this simple indexing best practice.

Small configuration choices can significantly impact performance when working with vector search engines such as Qdrant. One of the most common questions new users ask is:

**“Should I create my payload indexes before or after uploading data?”**

The short answer: **Both work, but you should create them *before* if you can.**

That simple decision can save you compute cycles and a lot of time. 

This blog post will explore why you should create payload indexes before uploading data. 

## How Indexing Works in Qdrant

Payload indexes allow you to filter data in Qdrant based on metadata. They act as secondary indexes for your vector data, allowing you to do things such as:

* Search with a specific category, for example, where `genre` is “sci-fi”.  
* Filter by date, region, and tags.   
* Combine vector similarity with your preferred filters. 

Qdrant makes this possible by augmenting its [HNSW graph](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/indexing/) with payload-aware data structures. The indexes allow the graph to be pruned early, speeding up querying.

## Before vs After: What’s the Difference? Here is a breakdown of indexing before and after uploading. 

When you define your payload indexes before uploading vectors:

* Qdrant will build the index once during ingestion.   
* The filtering structures are created as the data is added.   
* Indexing is efficient since there is no redundant computation. 


When you define your payload indexes after uploading vectors:

* Qdrant will scan and process all existing payloads again.   
* It will rebuild the entire index from scratch.  
* This creates an extra CPU and memory load, particularly on large datasets.

So while defining payload indexes is fully supported, it is not recommended because it triggers the index to be rebuilt. 

## When is It Okay to Index Later?

There are valid use cases for late indexing. For example, you can configure a new filter logic after launch. Still, it’s essential to be aware of the forthcoming performance cost. 

##  You should always index first if you know your filters upfront. If you need to index another payload later, you can still do it, but be aware of the performance hit. 

## Conclusion

Small configuration choices, such as when to index payloads, can have a massive impact, especially in a production environment. While you can disable indexing altogether, it’s not recommended since it will lead to slow queries. When working with Qdrant Cloud, filtering non-indexed payloads is disabled by default to ensure efficient querying.
