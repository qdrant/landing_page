# Scalability and Optimization

Tackle the memory and performance challenges of production-scale multi-vector search.

---

## Today's path

1. Memory Usage Implications and Solutions
2. Vector Quantization Techniques (Scalar, Binary, +1.5/2-bit)
3. Pooling Techniques (Row/Column, Hierarchical Token Pooling)
4. MUVERA for HNSW Compatibility
5. Multi-Stage Retrieval with Universal Query API
6. Evaluating Search Pipelines (Cost vs. Latency)

You'll master the optimization strategies needed to deploy multi-vector search at scale.
