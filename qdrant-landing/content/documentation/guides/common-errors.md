# Solving common errors

## Too many files open (OS error 24)

Each collection segment needs some files to be open. At some point you may encounter the following errors in your server log:

```text
Error: Too many files open (OS error 24)
```

In such a case you may need to increase the limit of the open files. It might be done, for example, while you launch the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --ulimit nofile=10000:10000 qdrant/qdrant:latest
```

The command above will set both soft and hard limits to `10000`.

If you are not using Docker, the following command will change the limit for the current user session:

```bash
ulimit -n 10000
```

Please note, the command should be executed before you run Qdrant server.

## Can't open Collections meta Wal

When starting a Qdrant instance as part of a distributed deployment, you may
come across an error message similar to this:

```bash
Can't open Collections meta Wal: Os { code: 11, kind: WouldBlock, message: "Resource temporarily unavailable" }
```

It means that Qdrant cannot start because a collection cannot be loaded. Its
associated [WAL](/documentation/concepts/storage/#versioning) files are currently
unavailable, likely because the same files are already being used by another
Qdrant instance.

Each node must have their own separate storage directory, volume or mount.

The formed cluster will take care of sharing all data with each node, putting it
all in the correct places for you. If using Kubernetes, each node must have
their own volume. If using Docker, each node must have their own storage mount
or volume. If using Qdrant directly, each node must have their own storage
directory.
