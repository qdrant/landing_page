# Power Apps

Microsoft [Power Apps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-apps) is a suite of apps, services, and connectors that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. You can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored in many online and on-premises data sources.

You can use the [Qdrant Connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/qdrant/) in Power Apps to add vector search capabilities to your flows.

## Prerequisites

1. A Qdrant instance to connect to. You can get a free cloud instance at [cloud.qdrant.io](https://cloud.qdrant.io/).
2. A [Power Apps account](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/power-platform/products/power-apps/) to develop your flows.

## Setting Up

Search for the Qdrant connector when adding a new action in a Power Apps flow. The connector offers an exhaustive list of pre-built Qdrant actions.

Set up a connection with the credentials of your Qdrant instance. The connection is verified upon creation.

Once a connection is set up, you can now build flows paired with the various connectors [supported by Power Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors/).
