title: Are your semantic search needs outgrowing Elastic and OpenSearch?<br>We can help.
description: "Qdrant is a Rust-native engine designed for vector + filter search from day one, so you get predictable p99 performance and simpler production ops. No GC pauses, no workaround-heavy architecture."
# quotes:
#   - Unacceptably slow queries with vector search
#   - Endless indexing jobs
#   - Overspending on over-provisioned memory
#   - Brittle hybrid search
# closingText: Lucene-based architectures just aren't built for scaling vector search.
