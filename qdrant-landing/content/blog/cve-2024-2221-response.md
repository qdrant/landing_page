### Summary

A security vulnerability has been discovered in Qdrant affecting all versions
prior to v1.8, described in [CVE-2024-2221](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-2221).
The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the
filesystem, which can be used to gain remote code execution.

The vulnerability does not materially affect Qdrant cloud deployments, as that
filesystem is read-only and authentication is enabled by default. At worst,
the vulnerability could be used by an authenticated user to crash a cluster,
which is already possible, such as by uploading more vectors than can fit in RAM.

Qdrant has addressed the vulnerability in v1.8.3 and above with code that
restricts file uploads to a folder dedicated to that purpose.

### Action

Check the current version of your Qdrant deployment. Upgrade if your deployment
is not at least v1.8.3.

To confirm the version of your Qdrant deployment in the cloud or on your local
or cloud system, run an API GET call, as described in the [Qdrant Quickstart
guide](/documentation/cloud/quickstart-cloud/#step-2-test-cluster-access).
If your Qdrant deployment is local, you do not need an API key.

Your next step depends on how you installed Qdrant. For details, read the
[Qdrant Installation](/documentation/guides/installation/)
guide.

#### If you use the Qdrant container or binary

Upgrade your deployment. Run the commands in the applicable section of the
[Qdrant Installation](/documentation/guides/installation/)
guide. The default commands automatically pull the latest version of Qdrant.

#### If you use the Qdrant helm chart

If youâ€™ve set up Qdrant on kubernetes using a helm chart, follow the README in
the [qdrant-helm](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant-helm/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#upgrading) repository.
Make sure applicable configuration files point to version v1.8.3 or above.

#### If you use the Qdrant cloud

No action is required. This vulnerability does not materially affect you. However, we suggest that you upgrade your cloud deployment to the latest version.
