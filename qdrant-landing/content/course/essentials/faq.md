# Qdrant Essentials FAQs

## Who is this course for?

Engineers and developers working with semantic or hybrid search, building LLM pipelines, or exploring vector databases for the first time. No prior experience with Qdrant or vector search is needed.

## Is the course free?

Yes, completely free. No credit card required.

## Do I get a certificate of completion? 

Yes! But just watching the videos doesn’t quite get you there. You need to [[insert instructions]](/#) to obtain the certification. And, you’ll also have your project to add to your portfolio!

## How much time should I spend on this course?

Each “Day” of this course is designed to be completed in 1 day. Day 0 is the quickest, and then there are 8 days of content. So you are looking at a minimum of 9 days, but don’t forget about the bonus content.

The good news is that you can take as much time as you need to complete the course since it is on-demand and at your own pace.

## What tools do I need?

Python, Docker, and optionally Qdrant Cloud. We walk you through setup on Day 0.

## Can I use Qdrant locally or do I need a cloud account?

You can do either. We support both local (via Docker) and Qdrant Cloud setups.

## What if I get stuck or have a question?

Join the Qdrant Discord. Our team and community are ready to help.

## Where can I get the code for the course? 

Look at each Day’s page of content. You can also find them in this repo.
