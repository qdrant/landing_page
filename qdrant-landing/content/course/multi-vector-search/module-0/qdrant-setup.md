# Qdrant Setup

Before diving into multi-vector search, you need a running Qdrant instance. Whether you choose Qdrant Cloud for a managed solution or a local deployment, this lesson will get you up and running.

Multi-vector search requires specific collection configurations that differ from traditional single-vector setups. We'll cover the essentials to prepare your environment.

## Qdrant Cloud Setup

<!-- TODO: Add instructions for setting up Qdrant Cloud account -->
<!-- TODO: Include screenshot of Cloud dashboard -->
<!-- TODO: Add cluster creation steps -->

## Local Qdrant Installation

<!-- TODO: Add Docker installation instructions -->

```bash
# TODO: Add Docker command to run Qdrant locally
```

<!-- TODO: Add alternative installation methods (pip, binary) -->

## Creating Your First Multi-Vector Collection

<!-- TODO: Explain multi-vector collection requirements -->
<!-- TODO: Add Python code example for creating a collection -->

```python
# TODO: Add example code for creating a multi-vector collection
```

## Verifying Your Setup

<!-- TODO: Add steps to verify Qdrant is running correctly -->
<!-- TODO: Add simple query example to test connection -->

```python
# TODO: Add verification code
```
