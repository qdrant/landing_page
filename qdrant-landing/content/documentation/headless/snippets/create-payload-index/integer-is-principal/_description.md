This code snippet demonstrates how to create a payload index for a timestamp field with an integer type. The "is_principal" property is set to true, indicating that this field will be used as the principal index for faster search performance. This feature is particularly useful for optimizing storage and speeding up search requests, especially when filtering data primarily based on the principal field, such as a timestamp in time-related data scenarios.
