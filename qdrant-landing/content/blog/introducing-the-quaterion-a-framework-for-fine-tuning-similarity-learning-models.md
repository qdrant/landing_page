We're happy to share the result of the work we've been into during the last months -
[Quaterion](https://quaterion.qdrant.tech/). It is a framework for fine-tuning similarity learning models that streamlines the training process to make it significantly faster and cost-efficient.
To develop Quaterion, we utilized PyTorch Lightning, leveraging a high-performing AI research approach to constructing training loops for ML models.

This framework empowers vector search [solutions](https://qdrant.tech/solutions/), such as semantic search, anomaly detection, and others, by advanced coaching mechanism, specially designed head layers for pre-trained models, and high flexibility in terms of customization according to large-scale training pipelines and other features.

Here you can read why similarity learning is preferable to the traditional machine learning approach and how Quaterion can help benefit <https://quaterion.qdrant.tech/getting_started/why_quaterion.html#why-quaterion>
