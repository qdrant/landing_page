Creates a payload index for a specific collection where the field is defined as a keyword type and marked as tenant-specific. This configuration allows Qdrant to optimize storage and retrieval by structuring the data based on the specified field for improved search efficiency of tenant-specific data subsets within the collection. This feature is particularly beneficial in multi-tenant environments where data subsets belong to different tenants, enabling more targeted and faster searches within the collection.
