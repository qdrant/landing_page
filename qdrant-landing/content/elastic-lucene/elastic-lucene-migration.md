subtitle: Seamlessly Bring Your Data to Qdrant with our Migration Tool.
description: Migrating from Elastic's Lucene-based stack doesn't have to mean starting over. Our Migration Tool lets you stream your existing vector data directly into Qdrant, live, fast, and with zero downtime. It works even while data is being inserted, supports reconfiguration, and eliminates the headaches of reindexing or overprovisioning.
