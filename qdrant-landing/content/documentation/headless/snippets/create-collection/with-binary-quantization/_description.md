This code configures a collection named `{collection_name}` with vectors of size 1536 and a distance metric of cosine. The collection is set up for binary quantization with the setting `always_ram` set to true. To enable binary quantization for an existing collection, a PATCH request or an `update_collection` method can be used, omitting the vector configuration as it is already defined.
