We are excited to announce that Qdrant has partnered with [Shakudo](https://www.shakudo.io/), bringing [Qdrant Hybrid Cloud](https://qdrant.tech/hybrid-cloud/) to Shakudo’s virtual private cloud (VPC) deployments. This collaboration allows Shakudo clients to seamlessly integrate Qdrant’s high-performance vector database as a managed service into their private infrastructure, ensuring data sovereignty, scalability, and low-latency vector search for enterprise AI applications.

## Data Sovereignty and Compliance with Secure Vector Search

Shakudo’s VPC deployments ensure that client data remains within their infrastructure, providing strict control over sensitive information while leveraging a fully managed AI toolset. Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is tailored for environments where data privacy and regulatory compliance are paramount. It keeps the data plane inside the customer's infrastructure, with only essential telemetry shared externally, guaranteeing database isolation and security, while providing a fully managed service.

## Scaling and Performance Optimization for Enterprise Vector Search

Qdrant Hybrid Cloud is optimized for Kubernetes, allowing for fast, automated deployments and hands-off cluster management. Shakudo’s platform, designed for VPC-based environments, allows businesses to deploy Qdrant’s vector search clusters with no DevOps overhead. Qdrant’s ability to handle billions of vectors - powered by our customized Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing - ensures real-time processing and high accuracy for AI-driven applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Staying Compatible with the Entire Stack

By deploying Qdrant Hybrid Cloud on Shakudo, organizations gain immediate compatibility with their existing data sources, pipelines, and applications. It integrates seamlessly with the existing stack, ensuring smooth and efficient operation across all components. As business needs evolve, the data stack can easily scale and adapt to new demands.
