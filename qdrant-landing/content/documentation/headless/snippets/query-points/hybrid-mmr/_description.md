This code snippet demonstrates Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) query functionality. MMR is a technique used to balance relevance and diversity in search results by combining similarity scores with a diversity penalty. The `diversity` parameter controls this balance: values closer to 0.0 prioritize relevance, while values closer to 1.0 prioritize diversity. This approach helps avoid redundant results by penalizing documents that are too similar to already selected ones, making it particularly useful for recommendation systems and diverse result sets.
