This code snippet demonstrates how to use the feature for looking up information from another collection while grouping data. By utilizing the `with_lookup` parameter in the request payload, you can efficiently retrieve shared information associated with points grouped by a specific identifier. This approach helps in reducing redundancy and optimizing storage space, especially when dealing with large payloads across multiple grouped points. The `with_lookup` parameter allows you to specify what data to bring from the related points in the lookup collection, such as titles and text, providing a consolidated view of information within each group.
