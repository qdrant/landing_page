# Solving common errors

## Too many files open (OS error 24)

Each collection segment needs some files to be open. At some point you may encounter the following errors in your server log:

```text
Error: Too many files open (OS error 24)
```

In such a case you may need to increase the limit of the open files. It might be done, for example, while you launch the Docker container:

```bash
docker run --ulimit nofile=10000:10000 qdrant/qdrant:latest
```

The command above will set both soft and hard limits to `10000`.

If you are not using Docker, the following command will change the limit for the current user session:

```bash
ulimit -n 10000
```

Please note, the command should be executed before you run Qdrant server.
