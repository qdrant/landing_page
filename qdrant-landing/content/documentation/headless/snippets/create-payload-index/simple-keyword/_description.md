Create a payload index by specifying the field name and setting its schema to 'keyword'. This allows for more efficient searching with filters in Qdrant. Indexing fields can impact the vector index as well. It is recommended to index fields that might heavily influence search results. For example, indexing the object ID, which is unique for each record, will be more efficient than indexing by color with only a few possible values. Qdrant will prioritize using the most restrictive index in compound queries involving multiple fields.
